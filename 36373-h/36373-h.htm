<h2><br /><br /> <a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>This Protest has been undertaken at the earnest
and repeated requests of Theosophical friends of
long standing. They feel strongly that the time
has come for one of H. P. Blavatsky's old pupils,
who was a member of her Inner Group, to
demonstrate as clearly as possible that the
teachings promulgated for nearly twenty years
past by the present leaders of the "Theosophical
Society" have departed more and more from
H. P. B.'s, and are now their direct antithesis,
particularly on the fundamental question of sex
morality.</p>

<p>Since Mr. G. R. S. Mead, one of my fellow-members
of the Inner Group, spoke out at the
Leadbeater Inquiry of 1906, and resigned, no
other surviving member, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, has attempted to stem the
awful and ever increasing tide of horror and
delusion, that is, engulfing&mdash;one might almost say
<i>has</i> engulfed&mdash;Mrs. Besant's Society. If Mr. Mead
could say in 1906;&mdash;"We stand on the brink of
an abyss," what is to be said now? The enquiries
and researches I have undertaken to enable me
to write this pamphlet have revealed the present
state of things to be far worse than I could have
imagined possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
From the time I left Mrs. Besant in 1895
and Mrs. Tingley in 1899, I have been out of
touch with these two movements, each calling
itself "theosophical" and each leader claiming to
be H. P. B.'s "successor." This is the reason
why I have hitherto kept silent; in fact, it was
not until I came to live in India in 1918, after
spending some years on the Continent, and met
some of the members&mdash;both Indian and European&mdash;who
had left Mrs. Besant in more recent years,
that I learnt of the appalling developments
since she became President and installed the sex
pervert Leadbeater as supreme esoteric teacher.</p>

<p>I feel that I should be failing in my duty,
and false to the solemn Pledges I have taken,
if I did not now do my utmost to clear H. P. B.'s
name from these horrible associations, and
demonstrate that they have nothing whatever
to do with her Masters (the Trans-Him&acirc;layan
Brotherhood) or Their Esoteric doctrine.</p>

<p>I therefore <span class="smcap">Protest</span> with all my strength,
and <i>in Their sacred Names</i>, against what is to
me a desecration and a blasphemy.</p>

<h2>
<br /><br /><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR the past fifteen years, despite repeated scandals,
exposures, and even the damning evidence produced
in various court cases, Mrs. Besant still persists
in her blind and fanatical support of the sex pervert and
pseudo-occultist C. W. Leadbeater, and the promulgation
of his delusive, immoral, and poisonous teachings among
the members of the Theosophical Society she rules, and the
public at large, to whom she is known chiefly as an able
speaker and an astute politician. Goaded by a revival
of the well-known evidence against Mr. Leadbeater, and
a severe criticism of her own actions, Mrs. Besant
published in her official organ (<i>Theosophist</i>, March, 1922.)
an article entitled "Whom Will Ye Serve?" and a long
Supplement addressed to the members, reiterating her
support of Mr. Leadbeater, and making statements in
justification of him and herself that call imperatively
for a dispassionate review of the history of this ill-omened
partnership, and the strongest possible protest
against the complete stultification and perversion of
H. P. Blavatsky's life-work and teaching that it involves.</p>

<p>I have no personal quarrel with Mrs. Besant, whose
brilliant intellectual gifts we all so much admired in the
early days, and who accomplished such splendid work
for the Cause during H. P. Blavatsky's lifetime. I had
already been a member of the Society for four years when
Mrs. Besant joined in 1889; and as we both subsequently
became members of the Inner Group of H. P. B.'s personal
pupils, I feel I am in a position to review the facts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
entitled to utter this protest. In fact, I can no longer
remain silent in the face of so much that is abhorrent
to every true Theosophist, to every devoted follower
of H. P. Blavatsky, her Masters, and Their teachings.</p>

<p>In a private letter to Mr. Judge, in or about 1887,
H. P. B. writes: "I am the mother and creator of the
Society; it has my magnetic fluid.... Therefore I
alone and to a degree ... can serve as a lightning
conductor of Karma for it. I was asked whether I was
willing, when on the point of dying&mdash;and I said 'Yes'&mdash;for
it was the only means to save it. Therefore I
consented to live...." Obviously, the only possible
conclusion to be drawn from this is that, when in 1891
H. P. Blavatsky passed away (or rather was "recalled")
nine years before the limit of time within which the
Masters' help could be given,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it was because They
saw that the T. S. had definitely failed, that it could
no longer be kept alive.</p>

<p>A long and, in this connection, very important
letter was written by H. P. Blavatsky in 1890 "To my
Brothers in Aryavarta," giving the real reason why she
did not return to India. Among other significant
statements which she makes (<i>Theosophist</i>, January, 1922.),
there is one which shows that she must clearly have
foreseen the ultimate disintegration of the Society, which
occurred in 1895. Writing of the shameful way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
she was thrown overboard, like a second Jonah, by
Colonel Olcott and the T. S. Council at Adyar in their
cowardly panic during the crisis of 1884-85, H. P. B.
says: "It was during that time ... that the seeds of
all future strifes, and&mdash;let me say at once&mdash;<i>disintegration
of the Theosophical Society</i> [Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.] were
planted by our enemies.... In a letter received from
Damodar in 1886 [He had been called by his Master
to Tibet the previous year.&mdash;A. L. C.] he notified me
that the Masters' influence was becoming with every
day weaker at Adyar." Further on in the letter H. P. B.
again refers to Adyar, and to an invitation to return
to India which "came too late ... nor can I, if I
would be true to my life-pledge and vows, now live at
the Headquarters <i>from which the Masters and Their
spirit are virtually banished. The presence of Their
portraits will not help; They are a dead letter.</i>" [Italics
mine. Yet Mrs. Besant asks us to believe that They
returned when she was elected President in 1907, and
even nominated her!&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>In the same letter H. P. B. says that she was pledged
never to reveal "the whole truth" about the Masters
to anyone, "excepting to those who like Damodar, had
been finally selected and called by Them." She also
speaks of him as "that one future Adept who has now
the prospect of becoming one day a Mahatma, Kali
Yuga notwithstanding." It is he again of whom she
spoke four years earlier, when she wrote: "During the
eleven years of the existence of the Theosophical Society
I have known, out of the seventy-two regularly accepted
<i>chelas</i> on probation and the hundreds of lay candidates&mdash;only
<i>three</i> who have not hitherto failed, and <i>one only</i>
who had a full success." ("The Theosophical Mahatmas."
<i>Path</i>, December, 1886.) Damodar is the only <i>chela</i>
she ever spoke of as a "full success" in her lifetime;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and it is worthy of special note that he was a high caste
Brahmin who did not hesitate to give up caste and
become a Buddhist (so Colonel Olcott states).</p>

<p>In the late spring Mrs. Besant paid a hasty visit to
Australia, whither her "brother-initiate" had to flee
from India some time since, as previously from London,
Paris, and America. The cause is always the same;
scandals inevitably arise, and Australia has proved no
exception. Mr. Leadbeater is a "Bishop" of the
"Liberal Catholic Church," an anomalous body warmly
supported and encouraged within and without the T. S.
by Mrs. Besant. Other of its bishops have incurred
similar odium and a "priest" has quite recently
confessed in writing and implicated the "Presiding
Bishop" and others. It has been stated that all
these men are being watched by the police, who
are only waiting to secure enough evidence. Matters
cannot go on much longer like this; and a
pamphlet published at New York last February says
that "with difficulty a delay of a few months has been
obtained in a pending arraignment and exposure in the
Public Press in America." When it comes it will be a
far graver indictment than that which precipitated the
'Besant <i>v.</i> Judge' crisis in 1894-95, and rent the T. S.
in twain. <i>Then</i> Mrs. Besant accused her colleague
Mr. Judge of "giving a misleading material form to
messages received psychically from the Master in various
ways ..." (<i>Enquiry</i> at London, July, 1894); but <i>now</i>
she is deliberately condoning, if not actually supporting,
something far worse which was investigated and found
true by a T. S. committee of enquiry in 1906.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the events succeeding
H. P. Blavatsky's death in 1891, I must add that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of us who supported Mr. Judge against Mrs. Besant's
charges came under the sway, after his death a year
later, of an equally masterful, able, and ambitious
woman having very similar characteristics and methods.
This was Mrs. Katherine Tingley, formerly a New York
professional psychic and trance medium, from whose
organisation ("The Universal Brotherhood") I resigned
in 1899. Her activities are now mainly confined to a
colony in California.</p>

<p>A point to which I think attention has not hitherto
been drawn is the striking similarity in the fate which
befell Mrs. Besant and Mr. Judge respectively after the
death of H. P. Blavatsky. Being left as the most obvious
leaders of the European and American Sections respectively
(neither of them were in England when she died),
the E. S. Council decided that they should carry on the
Esoteric School as joint Outer Heads in place of H. P. B.,
oblivious of the fact that one of them (Mrs. Besant) was
untrained, and both were unfit to fill such a high
occult office (<a href="#Page_86">see <i> post</i> p. 86</a>). This soon became evident
when each in turn fell an easy prey to external influences
which first separated them, and then disrupted the
Society and E. S.</p>

<p>Among the old T. S. and E. S. papers now lying
before me I find not a few which throw a most illuminating
light on Mrs. Besant's activities in recent years.
Before dealing with her latest statements I will quote
extracts from these papers in support and elucidation
of the points I wish to make, <i>viz</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) That under Mrs. Besant's guidance the T. S.
has long ceased to represent H. P. Blavatsky's
teaching, or the thought of its Founders.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That it is now completely dominated by the
deluded, impure, and poisonous ideas of an
acknowledged sex pervert, to whom this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
unhappy and misguided woman believes and
openly declares herself to be bound by indissoluble
and age-long ties.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That in adopting and conniving at the promulgation
of the teachings of this man, and allowing
him virtually to control her Society, Mrs.
Besant most impiously gives out that she is
acting under the orders of the Trans-Him㭡yan
Masters of Wisdom, and H. P. Blavatsky's
directions.</p></blockquote>

<p>This last point (<i>c</i>) is the real gravamen of my Protest.
It would be of relative unimportance&mdash;Mrs. Besant
having already wrecked the Society in 1895&mdash;that it had
descended to the level of any existing sect, Christian or
other (as much a close corporation as the Adventists or
New Jerusalemites), had its two present leaders dropped
the <i>title</i>, and ceased to claim any connection with the
"real Founders." But, on the contrary, Mrs. Besant
and Mr. Leadbeater use Their sacred names and declare
themselves to be under Their direct guidance. Such
proceedings merit the sternest possible moral condemnation
in view of the facts.<br /><br /></p>

" ... there remain but a few years to the last hour of the
term&mdash;namely, till December the 31st, 1899. Those who will not
have profited by the opportunity (given to the world in every last

already acquired. No Master of Wisdom from the East will himself
appear or send anyone to Europe or America after that period....
Such is the law, for we are in <i>Kali-Yuga</i>&mdash;the Black Age&mdash;and the
restrictions in this cycle, the first 5,000 years of which will expire
in 1897, are great and almost insuperable." (H. P. Blavatsky in the

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Kingsland" id="Kingsland"></a>Mr. William Kingsland on the Crisis of 1906</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first of the old papers I shall quote from is by my old
friend and fellow-Councillor Mr. William Kingsland,
author of <i>The Esoteric Basis of Christianity</i>
and kindred works. He was one of the leading members
in the early days under H. P. B. who, when Mrs. Besant
on securing the Presidency after Colonel Olcott's death
in 1907 reinstated Mr. Leadbeater, resigned their membership.
Mrs. Besant had reviewed a new book by Mr.
Kingsland, and took the opportunity to refer to his
resignation. Replying in "An Open Letter to Annie
Besant" dated December, 1909, he tells her:</p>

<blockquote><p>You have dragged in a perfectly irrelevant, uncalled-for
and untrue statement which I cannot allow to pass
unchallenged...." The words I refer to are these:
"We have here a very excellent Theosophical book, with
an evasion of all recognition of the source whence the
ideas are drawn. When Theosophy becomes fashionable,
how those who refuse to walk with her in the days of
scorning will crowd to claim her as theirs when she walks
in the sunshine amid applause!" Now these words
convey the implication, in the first place, that there is a connection
between the form in which my book is presented, and
recent events in the Theosophical Society which have led me
as well as many others, to sever our connection with that
Society; and, in the second place, that we now "refuse to
walk with her" because, forsooth, she is not now "fashionable,"
but "in the days of scorning." Neither of these statements
is true, and the implication is most unworthy of you....
That, however, is a small matter compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
implication that I and others have turned our backs on Theosophy
for so unworthy a reason.</p>

<p>Let me ask you to look at the names of the old and tried
workers whom you have forced out of the Society by your
disastrous policy, and then ask yourself in the Great Presence
whether it is true that any of them have deserted Theosophy&mdash;or
rather the Theosophical Society&mdash;because it is less
"fashionable" now than it was in the old days when you
and I and these others stood side by side and fought the battle
for H. P. Blavatsky. Did any of us shirk obloquy then,
and do you really think we are less ready to face it now? It
is one thing, however, to incur obloquy for the sake of Truth,
and quite another thing to be asked to do it <i>in support of
immoral teachings</i>.... What I want to point out now more
particularly, and in the interest of true Theosophy, is, that
you are now making the grand mistake&mdash;one never made by
H. P. Blavatsky&mdash;of thinking, writing, and speaking as if
Theosophy and the Theosophical Society were one and the
same thing, absoutely identical; and that there can be no
Theosophy in the world without the Theosophical Society,
and no Theosophists outside of it.... You must know that
in leaving the Theosophical Society, the great majority of us
at all events have not given up Theosophy, even if we may
feel compelled to teach it under another name, and though
we can no longer work with or through the Theosophical
Society, we are none the less carrying on the great work
which H. P. Blavatsky initiated.</p>

<p>But in the old days we did at least think that the Theosophical
Society stood for pure Theosophy and pure Morality.
<i>We cannot think or say this any longer.</i> The "Theosophy"
of the Theosophical Society is now a definite creed and dogma
based upon authoritative psychic pronouncements, from
which those who dare to differ are first of all squeezed out of
office by the President, and finally compelled to leave the
Society, being denounced in the strongest language as "persecutors"
and "haters." I am quite aware that all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
time you are preaching freedom of opinion; but that is one
of the farcical aspects of the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> which you inaugurated....
Whatever you may preach, it is now notorious that
your practice has been the exact reverse. You commenced
by turning out the Vice-President for daring to hold a different
opinion from your own as to the inception of the Society;
and you then proceeded so to manipulate matters that
several old and tried officials who had been in opposition
to your pronouncements and policy, were ousted from
their positions as General Secretaries of Sections.... Well,
you succeeded in getting your own supporters appointed&mdash;and
in losing many hundreds of old members.</p>

<p>Doubtless you will now have complete control and be
able to mould the Society to your own will and liking, and
train it to "obedience" to your psychic authority and visions.
At what expense and sacrifice of principles you have already
done this, we all know. But let none imagine that this is
the basis on which H. P. Blavatsky founded the Society; or
that it will thus fulfil the mission for which it was intended;
or that it can thereby become other than <i>a narrow and exclusive
sect</i>. And if perchance your statement is true that the
Theosophical Sciety&mdash;which you so mistakenly identify with
Theosophy&mdash;is now "in the days of scorning," possibly even
more than it was in the old days; What and who is it that
has made it so?</p>

<p>Is it not because the President and General Council have
set their seal and official condonation to a "theosophy"
<i>which countenances the grossest immorality</i>, and which can
advocate&mdash;as a means of "discharging [<i>sic</i>] thought-forms"
(see Van Hook's pamphlet)&mdash;a practice which you yourself
once characterised as being "when taught under the name of
Divine Wisdom, essentially earthly, sensual, devilish?" Yet
it is thus taught and justified&mdash;with an appeal to the laws of
reincarnation and <i>karma</i>&mdash;in Van Hook's pamphlet, which
you and the General Council have refused to repudiate, and
have thereby condoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
And now, since you have had your own way, and have
cleared the Society of the elements of the so-called "hatred
and persecution"; can you not at least refrain from hitting
behind our backs? Nothing is sadder for your old friends
and comrades than to see you stoop to veiled insinuations,
and even direct untruths; missing no opportunity&mdash;not
even in the review of a book&mdash;of striking unjustly and falsely
at those who have recently been your opponents, and who
have now no direct means of answering you, or of refuting
your statements within the Society itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have italicised a few passages which seem to be
of special importance as showing that, <i>thirteen years ago</i>,
Mr. Leadbeater's sinister hand had already grasped
the Society and its infatuated President, and that his
vile and immoral teachings, supported by her, had
driven out some of the oldest and most clear-headed
and clear-sighted of H. P. Blavatsky's friends and
pupils; among them Mr. G. R. S. Mead, one of the
Leadbeater Committee of Inquiry, who also resigned at
the time Mrs. Besant became President for the same
reasons as those stated by Mr. Kingsland. The
"practice" to which he alludes in his Open Letter is
of course now well known to be that taught and advocated
by Mr. Leadbeater, who claims that in so doing he is
acting on the advice and under the authority of one
of the Masters of Wisdom. Could a more terrible
infamy be perpetrated!<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Crisis" id="Crisis"></a>M. M. Schur&eacute; and L&eacute;vy on the Crisis of 1913</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ET us see, however, what others have to say seven
years later on the state of the T. S. In 1913 another
violent crisis convulsed this miserable travesty
of a Society that once stood for the highest principles
and ideals, but which even a Lake Harris might blush
now to be associated with. As before, it centred round
the shocking perverter of morals who had obtained
complete ascendancy over Mrs. Besant. A book entitled
<i>Mrs. Besant and the Present Crisis in the Theosophical
Society</i> was published in 1913 by M. Eug&egrave;ne L&eacute;vy,
"with a Prefatory Letter by M. Edouard Schur&eacute;," the
well-known author of <i>The Great Initiates</i> and other
mystical works. Writing to M. Charles Blech, General
Secretary of the French T. S., M. Schur&eacute; states that
he feels "compelled to retire officially from the T. S."
and that it is his "duty" to give his "reasons straightforwardly."
After alluding to the date (1907), when
M. Blech had offered and he had accepted the honorary
membership in the Society, M. Schur&eacute; goes on to speak
of Mrs. Besant, as she had then appeared to him, in
high terms, expressing the hope that "the nobility of
her past career" was an augury "that the T. S. would
continue in the broad way of tolerance, impartiality,
<i>and veracity</i> which forms an essential part of its programme."
M. Schur&eacute; then continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately things turned out otherwise. The primary
cause of this deviation lies in the close alliance of Mrs. Besant
with Mr. Leadbeater, a learned occultist, but of an unsettled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
disposition and doubtful morality. After Mr. Leadbeater
<i>had been found guilty</i> by an advisory Committee of the T.S.
Mrs. Besant publicly announced her reprobation of the
educational methods with which he was charged.... By
an inconceivable change of front she soon afterwards declared
her intention of bringing Mr. Leadbeater into the T.S. again
and she succeeded.... The excuses she gave for this recantation
were charity and pardon. <i>The real reason was that the
President needed Mr. Leadbeater for her occult investigations</i>,
and that this collaboration appeared to her necessary
to her prestige. To those who have followed her words
and acts from that time onwards, it is clearly manifest
<i>that Mrs. Besant has fallen under the formidable suggestive
power of her dangerous collaborator, and can only see, think
and act under his control</i>. The personality henceforward
speaking through her is ... the questionable visionary,
the skilful master of suggestion who no longer dares to show
himself in London, Paris, or America, but in the obscurity
of a summer-house at Adyar governs the T. S. through its
President. The ill-omened consequences of this influence
were soon to appear before the world through the affair of
Alcyone and the founding of the Order of the Star in the
East.... If a real Indian initiate, a Brahmin or otherwise,
of ripe age, had come to Europe on his own responsibility
or in the name of his Masters to teach his doctrines, nothing
would have been more natural or interesting.... But it was
not in this form that we beheld the new apostle from Adyar.
A young Indian, aged thirteen, <i>initiated by Mr. Leadbeater</i> ...
is proclaimed and presented to the European public as the
future teacher of the new era. Krishnamurti, now called
Alcyone, has no other credentials than his master's injunctions
and Mrs. Besant's patronage. His thirty-two previous incarnations
are related at length, the early ones going back to the
Atlantean period. <i>These narrations</i>, given as the result of
Mr. Leadbeater's and Mrs. Besant's visions, <i>are for the most
part grotesquely puerile</i>, and could convince no serious occultist.
They are ostensibly designed to prove that for twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or thirty thousand years the principal personages in the T. S.
have been preparing for the "Great Work" which is soon
to be accomplished. In the course of <i>their incarnations,
which remind one of a newspaper novel</i>, these personages are
decorated with the great names of Greek mythology, and
with the most brilliant stars in the firmament. During a
meeting at Benares, Krishnamurti presenting certificates to
his followers, received honours like a divine being, many
persons present falling at his feet. He does not, however,
utter a word, but only makes a gesture of benediction,
prompted by Mrs. Besant. In reporting this scene Mr. Leadbeater
likens it to the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost.</p>

<p>For this dumb prophet is founded the Order of the Star
in the East, which the whole world is invited to join, and of
which he is proclaimed the head ... this passive young
prodigy, who has not yet given the world the least proof of
having any mission at all [this is as true in 1922 as it was in
1913.&mdash;A. L. C.], becomes henceforth the centre and cynosure
of the T. S., the symbol and sacred ark of <i>the orthodox
faith at Adyar</i>. As to the doctrine preached by Mrs. Besant,
it rests on a perpetual equivocation. She allows the English
public at large, to whom she speaks of the coming Christ, to
believe that he is identical with the Christ of the Gospels,
whereas to her intimates she states what Mr. Leadbeater
teaches, and what he openly proclaims in one of his books,
<i>The Inner Life</i>&mdash;namely, that the Christ of the Gospels never
existed, and was an invention of the monks of the second
century. Such facts are difficult to characterise. I will
simply say that they are saddening for all who, like myself,
believed in the future of the T. S., for they can only repel
clear-sighted and sincere minds.... In my eyes, one can no
longer be an actual member of the T. S. without implicitly
approving the deeds and words of the President, which flagrantly
contradict the essential principle of the Society&mdash;I
mean <i>scrupulous and absolute respect for truth</i>. For these
reasons I regret that I must send you my resignation as a
member of the Theosophical Society.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
The italics throughout the foregoing quotations are
mine, and serve again to emphasise essential points;
points almost exactly similar to those raised by Mr.
Kingsland, the most serious being the condonation by
Mrs. Besant of immoral practices in a colleague whose
collaboration, as M. Schur&eacute; shrewdly adds, has become
a necessity to her, and under whose "formidable
suggestive power" she has now completely fallen. If
this was true in 1913, what may not be said in 1922,
when the intervening nine years have given time for
the growth and development of this deadly Upas Tree?
I use the simile advisedly, for this teaching <i>is</i> a "deadly"
poison, not only from the ordinary moral standpoint,
but especially from that of the esoteric teaching of
H. P. B. and the Trans-Him&acirc;layan Brotherhood, under
whose authority it is falsely and blasphemously given
out; I do not hesitate to declare it.</p>

<p>M. Schur&eacute;lso emphasises an important and vital
point which Mr. Kingsland seems to have felt equally
deeply, <i>viz.</i>&mdash;That Mrs. Besant has no use for any but
those who accept everything she says and does with
blind subservience, even when, in the eyes of such men
as M. Schur&eacute;, Mr. Mead, Mr. Kingsland, and others, it
merits strong condemnation as "untrue" and "misleading."
In the pages of the recent numbers of the
<i>Theosophist</i> the talk about "freedom of opinion" within
the Society is still repeated, although in actual practice,
as I have shown, the exact opposite obtains. Much that
emanates from this tainted source is so fantastic and
puerile that ridicule ought long since to have killed it,
as it did Oscar Wilde's &aelig;sthetic movement.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Return" id="Return"></a>Mrs. Besant's "return of the Christ."</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O return to M. L&eacute;vy's book; it deals with "Mrs.
Besant's Proceedings" under various headings.
In the one entitled "Mrs. Besant's Return of the
Christ" is to be found some of the most amazing balderdash&mdash;given
out as serious teaching!&mdash;it has ever been my lot
to encounter. For instance, a book called <i>Man: Whence,
How, and Whither</i>, written by Mrs. Besant and Mr.
Leadbeater in collaboration, is quoted from by M. L&eacute;vy
at considerable length. He explains that "the substitution
of a "false Christ" for the "Christ of the Gospels"
is here supported by "<i>a new order of evidence</i>" (Italics
mine). Specimens of this "evidence" follow, and I will
here give some of it in order to show the almost unbelievably
low level of intelligence to which this whole mischievous
movement&mdash;miscalled Theosophical&mdash;has descended,
and the sort of elements in human nature to
which such an ill-conceived and fantastic production is
designed to appeal. M. L&eacute;vy writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>In the course of their investigations these two occultists
look up on the one side, the past incarnations of him whom
Mrs. Besant calls the "Master Jesus," that is, of the
"Jesus" born 105 B.C.; and on the other side, the past lives
of the being whom she calls the "Lord Maitreya, the present
Bodhisattva, the Supreme Teacher of the World"; whose
ego at a given moment replaced that of "Jesus," this being
the last incarnation of the Christ whose immediate return
she is announcing.</p>

<p>Let us first quote from their account of the incarnations
of the "Supreme Teacher" ... In the chapter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
headed "Early Times on the Moon Chain," p. 34, we
read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a hut in which dwell a Moon-Man, his wife
and children; these we know in later times under the names
of Mars and Mercury, the Mahaguru and Surya. A number
of these monkey-creatures live round the hut, and give to
their owners the devotion of faithful dogs; among them we
notice the future Sirius, Herakles, Alcyone, and Mizar, to
whom we may give their future names for the purpose of
recognition, though they are still non-human."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the Fourth Root Race we again find the personage
supposed to be "Maitreya" as the husband of the ego
claimed by these authors as that of "Master K. H." Mrs.
Besant is again incarnated in the family as daughter, the eldest
sister of the "Master M."; "Maitreya," the future World-Teacher,
being at this time the head of the tribe (p. 113)....</p>

<p>We have thus reached to somewhere about the year
15,000 B.C., and then&mdash;incredible as it seems&mdash;they give
no further incarnations of him whom they nevertheless claim
to have been the World-Teacher at the beginning of our era.</p>

<p>They give us his incarnations as husband, as father, as
counsellor and priest, and are silent as to the only incarnation
of fundamental and vital importance to the whole world.</p>

<p>Let us see if the incarnations of their "Jesus" will fill
this gap in our knowledge, if they will throw light on this
essential point, thus left in obscurity.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We meet this "Jesus" for the first time at the beginning
of the Fifth Root Race, as daughter of Alcyone (Krishnamurti)
and sister of "Maitreya" (p. 252.)</p>

<p>Then, on p. 328, as the wife of Julius C&aelig;sar 18,878 B.C.,
he, or rather she, being at this time the widow of Vulcan
(Known in his last incarnation as Sir Thomas More)....</p>

<p>He is later identified as daughter of Alcyone-Krishnamurti
(his father) and Fabrizio Ruspoli (his mother),<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> parents
at the same time of the future "World-Teacher, Maitreya,"
their young daughter. These incarnations took place 72,000
B.C., on the shores of the Lake of Gobi, we are told on p. 490.</p>

<p>In 15,910 B.C., we find "Jesus" as grandson of
"Maitreya," and as father and grandfather of a large family
composed, as in all cases investigated by these two authors,
of <i>present</i> members of the Theosophical Society <i>only</i>, and
including the faithful friends of Adyar <i>to the exclusion of all
others</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>" ... In 12,800 B.C. the "Jesus" of these investigations
again forms part of a very extensive family composed
as usual of the selfsame elements, and including amongst
the names known in the theosophic world that of Mme. Marie
Louise Kirby (an Italian theosophist recently at Adyar)
who was his sister. "Jesus" was then the father of Mrs.
S. Maud Sharpe (General Secretary of the English Section), of
Julius C&aelig;sar, and of T. Subba Rao;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the Teshu Lama being at that time his daughter, etc., etc. (p. 499)....</p>

<p>Once more have our hopes been betrayed, for an absolute
silence broods over the Incarnations of "Jesus" later than
this date of 13,500, as it reigned over those of the "World-Teacher"....</p>

<p>We cannot, however, conceive that this information
gathered from occult investigation will be felt to be indispensable
by anyone. Now that we know that Mrs. Besant's
"World-Teacher" is an ordinary man of the lunar chain (to
whom Mrs. Besant was first domestic animal and then sister,
and who, in the early period of our earth, was daughter of
the young Krishnamurti (or of M. Ruspoli), who could be
found still to imagine that there could be here any question,
save a mad or impious joke"....</p></blockquote>

<p>Incredible as it may appear to those who know
anything of H. P. Blavatsky's teachings, their comprehensive
grandeur and sublimity, especially as given in
<i>The Secret Doctrine</i>, this extraordinary mixture of clumsy
fairy-tale and extravagant and even malicious mumbo-jumbo
is apparently swallowed whole by the blind and
credulous followers of this grotesque "Neo-Theosophy."
Not so much for them do I write as for those who,
while interested in these subjects, have neither the
inclination nor the leisure to examine, for instance,
such published Records as these from which I quote,
for themselves. Such would naturally accept on
their face value Mrs. Besant's own account of herself
and of her Society, unaware that she is no longer
anything but a "blind leader of the blind," incapable of
distinguishing light from darkness, truth from falsehood.
We have direct testimony to the truth of this statement
in Mr. T. H. Martyn's now famous letter to Mrs. Besant.
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
In it he tells her:&mdash;"You have been relying upon
C. W. L. as <i>sole intermediary between the Hierarchy</i>
[the Trans-Him&acirc;layan Brotherhood, the Masters of
Wisdom. Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.] and yourself for
many years.... C. W. L.'s word is final and his
seership infallible to you." The quality of this
supposed "seership" bears a very close resemblance to
a stupid and vulgar hoax. This is clearly shown by
Mr. Martyn, who says:&mdash;"In 1919 I went to America.
Young Van Hook was in New York. He talked freely
of C. W. L.'s immorality and about <i>faking the 'lives'
of people</i>" (Italics mine.) Mr. Martyn then puts together
various pieces of evidence against this man, and tells
Mrs. Besant that he finds "staring me in the face the
conclusions that <i>Leadbeater is a sex pervert</i>, his mania
taking a particular form which I have&mdash;though only
lately&mdash;discovered, is a form well known and quite
common in <i>the annals of sex criminology</i>." (Italics mine.)
This sex criminal, then, is the creature whom Mrs. Besant
has accepted "for many years" as "sole intermediary
between" herself and&mdash;<i>the Masters of Wisdom</i>!! One
almost hesitates to draw the obvious inference; for this
is the man whom she has for years held up to and imposed
upon their followers as a model of all the virtues&mdash;"a
saint"&mdash;a person "on the threshold of divinity."
(<a href="#Footnote_11_11">See also footnote <i>post</i>, p. 56</a>.)</p>

<p>Why has it always been necessary for Mrs. Besant
to have an "intermediary"? Before Mr. Leadbeater
it was her Brahmin guide, and before him it was Mr.
Judge. To each in turn she gave implicit belief in the
matter of "messages" and directions from the Masters,
while outwardly claiming "direct" communication. The
fact is that, as I have come to believe, the plain psychology
of the thing is&mdash;sheer femininity. With all her intellectual
talents, her once clear brain, Mrs. Besant is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
(in her personality) just simple <i>woman</i>, relying upon
male guidance and authority as instinctively as any of
her humbler sisters. And what student of human nature
will fail to recognise in her that purely feminine trait
of blind and fanatical "obedience" which loves to receive
and obey "orders" even though the result should be
"a world in ruins"? The existence of this fundamental
and essential quality in female human nature is the real
reason why even the most broad-minded men shrink
from giving women equality of power with themselves
in wordly affairs.</p>

<p>Let me here declare what I believe to be the real
truth; namely, that after H. P. Blavatsky's death in
1891, neither Mrs. Besant, nor Mr. Judge, nor Colonel
Olcott, nor anyone else, could "communicate," because
<i>H. P. B.'s withdrawal meant the withdrawal of her Masters
as well</i>. It has always seemed strange to me that this
was never realised by anyone, for in this pamphlet I
have quoted quite enough from H. P. B. to make it
perfectly clear. Does she not say in the 1890 letter to
the Indians (<a href="#Page_2">see p. 2</a>) that after she had to leave
India in 1885 the Masters' influence at Adyar became
a dead letter? Did not the Masters Themselves write
as early as 1884 that they could only communicate
through her or in places previously prepared magnetically
by her presence? How, then, could They be expected
to continue to communicate or direct the affairs of the
T. S. (as They did in India until 1885), or the E. S.
(as They did from 1888 to 1891), after They had withdrawn
the Agent They had so carefully prepared and
subjected to the severest trials and initiations in Tibet?
Barely three years after this withdrawal the fatal "Split"
took place owing to Mr. Judge giving out what purported
to be "direct" communications, but which, as I discovered
after working for a time under his inspirer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
successor, Mrs. Tingley, <i>were obtained from her</i>. Mrs.
Besant, in accusing him, did precisely the same, for
she stated in her <i>Case against W. Q. Judge</i> that she had
received her orders direct from the Master, whereas
(as I relate elsewhere, <a href="#Page_56"><i>post</i>, p. 56</a>) she admitted to the
Inner Group that they came "through" her Brahmin
guide.</p>

<p>This, then, was the great and fundamental error
committed by the leaders of the movement, after H. P. B.
was withdrawn. It is responsible for all the subsequent
troubles, and the appalling situation with which we are
faced to-day. A great and world-wide organisation is
being used to promulgate blasphemous, poisonous and
absolutely anti-Theosophical and anti-Occult doctrines
as emanating direct from the Masters who definitely
withdrew Their chosen Agent in 1891. (<a href="#Page_2">See <i>ante</i> p. 2.</a>)</p>

<p>In any case, even had she lived, H. P. B. told the
E. S. that the "last hour of the term" was December
31st, 1899, after which "no Master of Wisdom from the
East will himself appear or send anyone to Europe or
America." (<a href="#Footnote_2_2">See footnote, <i>ante</i> p. 2.</a>) She also said that
the next Messenger would be sent out in 1975. Yet
the fiction that the Masters are still directing the leaders
and the movement is kept up, not only by Mrs. Besant,
but also by Mrs. Tingley, 22 years after "the last hour
of the term."</p>

<p>It is the same with all this wild talk about the
imminent advent of a "World-Teacher." Is this in the
least probable, in view of the above pronouncements?
H. P. B. definitely states in <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> the
exact opposite; but all the Neo-Theosophists seem to
prefer the Besant and Leadbeater books. H. P. B. says,
with reference to this very Maitreya whose name they so
lightly take in vain, that He is not due until the Seventh
Sub-Race, <i>i.e.</i>, several thousand years hence; and that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in any case, "it is not in the <i>Kali Yug</i>, our present
terrifically materialistic age of Darkness, the 'Black
Age,' that a new Saviour of Humanity can ever appear."
(S. D. Third Ed., Vol. I, p. 510 <i>et seq.</i> See also <i>Theosophical
Glossary</i>, "Kalki Avatar" and "Maitreya
Buddha.") If we accept H. P. B.'s authority there is
no evading this issue, and we must reject the Besant-Leadbeater
pretensions <i>in toto</i>, for their absurdity is
patent. Yet they claim to have been specially taught
and prepared by her to carry on her message! (<i>Vide</i>
Mrs. Besant in the <i>Theosophist</i>, March, 1922; and also

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Occult" id="Occult"></a>Fundamental causes: Some Occult Methods</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>NDER this heading M. L&eacute;vy deals with what he calls
"the pitiful climax of this parody":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>What a contrast to the great traditions of the Theosophical
movement, formulated by H. P. Blavatsky in <i>The Key to
Theosophy</i> (Third Edition, p. 191);&mdash;"As for our best
Theosophists, they would also far rather that the names of
the Masters had not been mixed up with our books in any way."
And later, on p. 192;&mdash;"I say again, every earnest Theosophist
regrets to-day, from the bottom of his heart, that these sacred
names and things have ever been mentioned before the
public." And this would be the moment to say with Mme.
Blavatsky;&mdash;"Great are the desecrations to which the names
of two of the Masters have been subjected." ... But when
all is said and done, what <i>is</i> this occultism which produces
<i>such disregard of truth, such calumny in daily life, such diastrous
confusion in the domain of clairvoyance</i>, and finally, <i>advice
of such a kind as to arouse universal disgust</i>? [Italics
mine.&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>This occultism has its methods, as all schools of occultism
have; for occultism consists in a methodical training and
the awakening of consciousness to superior worlds; and
where a method produces such results, may we not regard
it as legitimate to ask what is the source of such serious
and such numerous aberrations?... On this question, as
on all those that we have examined, we will cite as witnesses
original documents, the appraisements of those who teach
their own methods. It is well known that Mr. Leadbeater is
the inventor and manipulator of the Adyar occultism. In
the <i>Inner Life</i> (Vol. I, p. 450), in speaking of the centres, the
awakening of which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as we know, developes clairvoyance,
he expresses himself in these terms;&mdash;"I have heard it
suggested that each of the different petals of these force-centres
represents a moral quality, ... I have not yet met
with any facts which confirm this ... <i>their development
seems to me to have no more connection with morality than has
the development of the biceps</i>." [Italics mine. A little later
I shall quote some very definite pronouncements of H. P.
Blavatsky's which teach the exact opposite.&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>Further, it is of interest to find Mrs. Besant and Mr.
Leadbeater, in the first lines of the Preface to <i>Man; Whence
How, and Whither</i>, expressing the same view as regards
the connection between morality and clairvoyance&mdash;"It
is not generally accepted, nor indeed is it accepted to any
large extent ... [clairvoyance] is a power latent in all men
... it can be developed by any one who is able and willing
to pay the price demanded for its forcing, ahead of the general
evolution."</p>

<p>Mrs. Besant is no less positive. A price is demanded
for the "forcing" of clairvoyance, but this price is neither
"high spirituality" nor "lofty intelligence," nor even
"purity of character" ... she fully shares the views of Mr.
Leadbeater....</p>

<p>Thus the calumny, sectarianism, the disregard of truth
in daily life, the increasingly serious aberrations in the spiritual
life, have gradually revealed the main source of all
these facts, <i>i. e.</i>, the defect of the method.</p>

<p>All becomes clear. Mr. Leadbeater is probably right,
and it may be possible to develop, as he claims, a certain
clairvoyance (an inferior clairvoyance, it must be said) without
the concurrence of a moral and mental training.... But
who will maintain that without moral purification we shall
possess that moral sense that inspires gracious and noble
conduct, and teaches us to hate falsehood?... be
able to distinguish illusions from reality in our astral
visions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater are most certainly not
ignorant of the dangers of occult development without
morality. But it is quite another matter to profess this
theory, or even to lean towards morality in the course
of occult development, <i>by means of ... generous aspirations
perpetually evoked in eloquent language</i>, from setting to work
on the development of these centres by means of exercises
arranged with the express purpose of bringing in the <i>practice</i>
of morality, of truth, and of logic as powerful factors in
the reorganisation of the subtle bodies&mdash;which produces
clairvoyance.... That method which dissociates moral and
intellectual aspiration from occult development, and seeks
to cultivate them separately, will not achieve moral progress
since <i>the inner nature is not transmuted</i>; but this method will
produce a very debauch of phrases invoking these aspirations.
For, instead of penetrating by means of the appropriate
practice into the inner regions of the soul, these aspirations
swirl, so to say, perpetually on the surface of the mind.
Their presence there will produce a kind of psychic intoxication,
sometimes rousing in the occultist thoughts so much
above his own mental and moral standard, that he may come
to regard himself as a saint, while at the same time performing
the most despicable actions. Indeed, during such times the
conduct shows a moral retrogression very noticeable when
compared with the conduct before this occult development
For this latter <i>increases and intensifies all the temptations</i>, as
every occultist will admit. An increase of active morality is
therefore, required if we would avoid this most dangerous lack
of balance....</p>

<p>We find constantly in Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater,
under a great show of high moral aspirations, the reality of
an actual moral and intellectual fall. Much emphasis
is placed on "liberty of thought" [<a href="#Page_14">see p. 14</a> A. L. C.], and at
the same time the intellectual desertion of this principle is
preached in counselling members to give blind obedience to
"the least hint which falls from the lips of Mrs. Besant," and
to follow her implicitly whether she is understood or not....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
We see clearly that the fruits are precisely those we
should expect from the seed; the terrible danger of this
method can neither be misunderstood nor denied ... [we
must] never lend ear to the words which in this school quite
naturally take the place of the honest and right
act, and so turn attention from the moral ugliness of the
actions performed.... <i>Acts alone show forth morality, not
attractive formulas flowing from literary or oratorical talent.</i>
The constant declaration of liberty of thought, of human
brotherhood, cannot impress us when the actions of those who
delight in them enslave thought, persecute merit, seek to
poison souls by flimsy and deceptive spiritual pronouncements....</p>

<p>It is a painful duty to have to press this point with such
insistence. But now that we are facing the consequences of
the Leadbeater method on the mental character of the clairvoyant,
our warnings in reference to still more serious harm
will not appear exaggerated.</p>

<p>We know that the higher regions of the invisible worlds
are those in which "consciousness" manifests itself principally
in the most intense awareness of moral beauty.</p>

<p>Since this is so, the cultivation of the non-moral clairvoyance
could only attain results in the lower regions of the
astral world ... the organ of clairvoyant sight, when developed
according to certain methods, will be blind to the moral
outline of subtle worlds, <i>and will thus be cut off from all their
truly spiritual content. The field of their experiences will be
limited to the lower regions of the astral plane.</i></p>

<p>And it is these lower visions, more frequently experienced
because of <i>their affinity to elements in the vehicles of the investigator
not yet purified, that will be presented as the most sublime
images of the higher worlds</i>. For such a clairvoyant is deprived
of the high morality which is the force leading our "bodies"
by affinity towards truly spiritual Beings [<i>e.g.</i>, the Masters
in Their Mahatmic "bodies".&mdash;A. L. C.] Deprived of the
standard of comparison that these provide, <i>he will be the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<i>victim of all the illusions of a world that is the veritable motherland
of illusions, for human errors are but the faint reflection of
these</i>. Since the sense of responsibility, which is essentially
moral in origin [H. P. Blavatsky says; "<i>The sense of Responsibility
is the beginning of Wisdom.</i>" A. L. C.] will equally
fail him, <i>he will have no scruple in sharing his illusions with all
in making known his misleading experiences</i>&mdash;the less since
the forces, whose sport he is, push him irresistibly to this.
Are they not in truth the adversaries of the divine scheme
of evolution, <i>the servants and sowers of error and immorality
the world over</i>?</p></blockquote>

<p>In these clear and logical arguments M. L&eacute;vy
expresses, even in a translation, so much better than
I could have done, the dangers of the way leading
to the path of "error" which Mrs. Besant is now treading,
that I have quoted at greater length than I originally
intended. Although written nine years ago, they are
more than ever true to-day. M. L&eacute;vy then continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>We have thus sketched in their broad hypothetical outlines
<i>the incalculable reactions that the defect in the Leadbeater
method brings into the inner life, into the words and actions of
those who yield their souls to him</i>.</p>

<p>In demonstrating the fatal effects of this method we
have shown the real meaning of the faults and failings of all
kinds as exhibited by Mrs. Besant, who is its most fervent
adherent. The right interpretation of the known facts seems
to us so entirely in conformity with the consequences, as
implied in our hypothesis, as to make it possible to some
extent to foresee these facts with scientific certainty&mdash;which
is precisely what has happened....</p>

<p>We recall the "Leadbeater Case," which in 1906 [this was
the Committee of Inquiry in London, above referred to.&mdash;A. L. C]
called forth within the Theosophical Society, no
less than outside, unanimous moral censure.... Resigning
from the Theosophical Society in consequence of this affair,
Mr. Leadbeater has since returned, at the invitation of Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Besant.... Have the principles and methods of Mr. Leadbeater
changed since he has returned to his place amongst us?
He himself informs us on this point in a letter written after
the "affair," at the express desire of Mrs. Besant that he
should "define his position" at the time she started the
well-known campaign in favour of his re-admission (<i>Theosophist</i>,
February 1908.)</p>

<p>"You ask me," says Mr. Leadbeater, "to write you a
clear letter that you may show at need, expressing my real
views on the advice I gave some time ago to certain young
boys. I need hardly say that I keep my promise not to
repeat the advice, for I defer to your opinion that it is dangerous.
I also recognise, as fully as yourself, that it would be
if it were promiscuously given, but I have never thought of
so giving it."</p>

<p>In this declaration Mr. Leadbeater first recognises the
danger of his advice, then immediately retracts this confession
by reservations which imply its harmlessness in just
those cases for which he is blamed. He has not, as we see
from this letter, then, changed his views; but the important
fact is that he only speaks of "danger," and never of "immorality."
<i>His moral standpoint remains, then, unaltered&mdash;is
precisely the same as before the expos&eacute;.</i></p>

<p>And what is this point of view? Mrs. Besant thus gives
it in a letter dated July, 1906 (<i>Theosophic Voice</i>, May, 1908):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Leadbeater appeared before the Council of the
British Section, representatives from the French and the
American Sections being present and voting. Colonel Olcott
in the chair. <i>He denied none of the charges</i>, but in answer to
questions, very much strengthened them, for he alleged....
<i>So that the advice ... became advice putting foul ideas into
the minds of boys innocent of all sex impulses.... It was
conceivable that the advice, as supposed to have been given, had
been given with pure intent, and the presumption was so in a
teacher of theosophical morality; anything else seemed incredible.
But such advice as was given in fact, such dealing with boys</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<i>before sex passion had awakened, could only be given with pure
intent if the giver were, on this point, insane.</i>" [Italics mine.
The details omitted cannot be put in print.&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>"Let me here place on record my opinion that such
teaching as this, given to men, let alone to innocent boys, is
worthy of the sternest reprobation. It distorts and perverts
the sex impulse ... degrades the ideas of marriage, fatherhood
and motherhood ... befouls the imagination, pollutes
the emotions, and undermines the health. Worst of all that
it should be taught under the name of Divine Wisdom, being
essentially 'earthly', 'sensual', 'devilish.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Besant's last sentence contains the whole
<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of this my Protest. She has expressed
precisely the views I hold; but in this fervid condemnation
she herself must now be included, since she
condones and thus supports this horror. M. L&eacute;vy
graphically portrays for us on what road it is that this
once apparently sane and normal woman, with all her
great gifts, is descending&mdash;a road that, as H. P. Blavatsky
puts it in the concluding paragraph of <i>Occultism</i> versus
<i>the Occult Arts</i>, "can lead only to Dugpa-ship." (<a href="#Page_33">see <i>post</i>
p. 33.</a>) He continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. Besant then deemed Mr. Leadbeater's morality so
defective as to be accounted for only by mental derangement.
Nevertheless, the promise contained in the letter just quoted
and which expresses no shadow of moral repentance whatsoever,
nor anything approaching it, was sufficient, in Mrs.
Besant's eyes, to justify her in bringing back into the
Theosophical Society a teacher she has judged thus. Could
one ask a clearer proof of the anarchy produced by such
occultism?</p>

<p>A recent suit, instituted by the parent of the young
Krishnamurti, re-claiming the custody of his child, brings
forward again this question of morality ... reminding us
of the expos&eacute;. In fact, the present case clearly formulates
the accusation of immoral conduct testified to by witnesses ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
In such a discussion, this attempt [by Mrs. Besant] to
play upon the political interests of the judges is unexpected,
amazing,&mdash;and, alas! significant. We see clearly that a
mind that shows itself capable of throwing into the balance
political (and racial) appeals in a matter of conduct, is utterly
blind to the question of human consideration [a Brahmin
father re-claiming his young sons] that overshadows this
whole case.</p>

<p>Clear and unmistakable through all these actions shows the
consistent distortion of the moral outlook, more serious since
the esoteric ethics should be an extension, a purification, an
exaltation of exoteric morality, and in no circumstances its
decline, its degradation, its negation. And if we would
realise to what extent this moral outlook can be warped under
certain influences, we need but to hear Mrs. Besant say of
Mr. Leadbeater:&mdash;"By hard, patient work he has won rewards
... until he stands perhaps the most trusted of his Master's
disciples on the threshold of Divinity." (<i>Theosophist</i>,
November, 1911, p. 308.)</p>

<p>This conception of the "Divinity" that should be the
the final expression of morality has no need of comment other
than that same "deification" by his colleague&mdash;who five
years earlier regarded his teaching as so utterly immoral as to
suggest mental derangement as the only explanation....
Perhaps we shall understand these things a little better if
we remember that this occultist, if he contradicts the Buddha,
on the other hand almost deifies Mrs. Besant. Possibly
taking into consideration this exchange of admiration, the
meaning of the "deifications" will become sufficiently clear.<br /><br /></p></blockquote>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Occultism" id="Occultism"></a>H. P. Blavatsky on true Occultism.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE giving some fine passages from M. L&eacute;vy's
concluding chapters I will quote from H. P. Blavatsky's
<i>Practical Occultism: Occultism</i> versus <i>the
Occult Arts</i>, mentioned a few pages back. In its original
form it is a booklet containing a reprint of two articles
which she wrote for <i>Lucifer</i> in 1888, shortly before she
founded the Esoteric Section. These extracts will show
the "true" teaching in this matter of Occultism, as
contrasted with the "false," or Mrs. Besant's and Mr.
Leadbeater's. H. P. B. begins by declaring that: "There
are not in the West half-a-dozen among the fervent
hundreds who call themselves 'Occultists' who have
even an approximately correct idea of the nature of the
Science they seek to master. With a few exceptions,
they are all on the highway to sorcery.... Let them
first learn the true relation in which the Occult Sciences
stand to Occultism.... [It] differs from Magic and
other secret sciences as the glorious sun does from a
rush-light, as the immutable and immortal Spirit of
Man&mdash;the reflection of the absolute, causeless and
unknowable ALL&mdash;differs from the mortal clay&mdash;the
human body.... [The word] OCCULTISM is certainly
misleading, translated as it stands from the compound
word <i>Gupta-Vidya</i> (Secret. Knowledge.) But the knowledge
of what? Some of the Sanskrit terms may
help us.</p>

<p>"There are four (out of the many other) names of
the various kinds of Esoteric Knowledge or Sciences
given, even in the exoteric Pur㯡s. There is (1) <i>Yajna-Vidya</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
knowledge of the occult powers awakened in
Nature by the performance of certain religious ceremonies
and rites. (2) <i>Mahavidya</i>, the 'great knowledge,' the
magic of the Kabalists and of the <i>Tantrika</i> worship,
often Sorcery of the worst description. (3) <i>Guhya-Vidya</i>,
knowledge of the mystic powers residing in Sound
(Ether), hence in the Mantras (chanted prayers or incantations),
and depending on the rhythm and melody used;
in other words, a magical performance based on knowledge
of the Forces of Nature and their correlation;
and (4) <i>Atma-Vidya</i>, a term which is translated simply
'Knowledge of the Soul,' <i>true Wisdom</i> by the Orientalists,
but which means far more.</p>

<p>"This last is the only kind of Occultism that any
Theosophist who admires 'Light on the Path,' and who
would be wise and unselfish, ought to strive after. All
the rest is some branch of the 'Occult Sciences,' <i>i.e.</i>,
arts based on the knowledge of the ultimate essence
of all things in the kingdoms of Nature&mdash;such as minerals,
plants and animals&mdash;hence of things pertaining to the
realm of <i>material</i> nature, however invisible that essence
may be, and howsoever much it has hitherto eluded the
grasp of Science.... <i>Siddhis</i> (or the Arhat powers)
are only for those who are able to 'lead the life,' and to
comply with the terrible sacrifices required for such
a training, and to comply with them <i>to the very letter</i>.
Let them know at once and remember always, that true
Occultism or Theosophy is the 'Great Renunciation of
SELF,' unconditionally and absolutely, in thought as in
action. It is ALTRUISM, and it throws him who
practises it out of the ranks of the living altogether.
'Not for himself, but for the world he lives,' as soon as he
has pledged himself to the work. Much is forgiven
during the first years of probation. But, no sooner is
he 'accepted' than his personality must disappear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
he has to become a <i>mere beneficent force in Nature</i>. There
are two poles for him after that, two paths, and no
midway place of rest. He has either to ascend laboriously
step by step, often through numerous incarnations and
<i>no Devachanic break</i>, the golden ladder leading to
Mahatmaship (the <i>Arhat</i> or <i>Bodhisattva</i> condition),
or&mdash;he will let himself slide down the ladder at the first
false step, and roll down into <i>Dugpa-ship</i>....<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"All this is either unknown or left out of sight
altogether. Indeed, one who is able to follow the silent
evolution of the preliminary aspirations of the candidates
often find strange ideas quietly taking possession of their
minds. There are those whose reasoning powers have
been so distorted by foreign influences that they imagine
that animal passions can be so sublimated and elevated
that their fury, force and fire can, so to speak, be turned
inwards ... <i>until their collective and unexpanded strength
enables their possessor to enter the true Sanctuary of the
Soul</i>, and stand therein in the presence of the <i>Master</i>&mdash;the
HIGHER SELF.... Oh, poor blind visionaries!...
Strange aberration of the human mind. Can it be so?
Let us argue.</p>

<p>"The 'Master' in the Sanctuary of our souls is
'the Higher Self'&mdash;the divine spirit whose consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
is based upon and derived solely (at any rate during the
mortal life of the man in whom it is captive) from the
mind, which we have agreed to call the <i>Human Soul</i> (the
'Spiritual Soul' being the vehicle of the Spirit.) In its
turn the former (the <i>personal</i> or human soul) is a
compound, in its highest form of spiritual aspirations,
volitions and divine love; and in its lower aspect, of
animal desires and terrestrial passions imparted to it
by its association with its vehicle, the seat of all these ...
the <i>inner animal</i>. [It] is the instinctual 'animal soul,'
and is the hotbed of those passions which ... are
lulled instead of being killed, ... And where, on what
neutral ground, can they be imprisoned so as not to
affect man?</p>

<p>"The fierce passions of love and lust are still alive,
and they are allowed to still remain in the place of their
birth&mdash;<i>that same animal soul</i>.... It is thus the mind
alone&mdash;the sole link and medium between the man of
earth and the Higher Self&mdash;that is the only sufferer,
and which is in incessant danger of being dragged down by
those passions, that may be re-awakened at any moment
and perish in the abyss of matter.... How can harmony
prevail and conquer, when the soul is stained and distracted
with the turmoil of passions and the terrestrial
desires of the bodily senses, or even of the 'Astral man'?</p>

<p>"For this 'Astral'&mdash;the shadowy 'double' (in
the animal as in man) is not the companion of the <i>divine
Ego</i> but of the <i>earthly body</i>. It is the link between the
personal self, the lower consciousness of <i>Manas</i>, and the
Body, and is the vehicle of <i>transitory, not of immortal
life</i>.... It is only when the power of the passions
is dead altogether, and when they have been crushed and
annihilated in the retort of an unflinching will; when not
only all the lusts and longings of the flesh are dead,
but also the recognition of the personal Self is killed out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and the 'Astral' has been reduced in consequence to
a cipher, that the Union with the 'Higher Self' can
take place. Then when the 'Astral' reflects only the
conquered man, the still living but no more the longing,
selfish personality, then the brilliant <i>Aug&#339;ides</i>, the
divine SELF, can vibrate in conscious harmony with
both the poles of the human Entity&mdash;the man of
matter purified, and the ever pure Spiritual Soul&mdash;and
stand in the presence of the MASTER SELF, the
Christos of the mystic Gnostic, blended, merged into,
and one with IT for ever.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"How, then, can it be thought possible for a man to
enter the 'strait gate' of occultism when his daily and
hourly thoughts are bound up with worldly things,
desires of possession and power, with lust, ambition,
and duties which, however honourable, are still of the
earth, earthy? Even the love for wife and family&mdash;the
purest as the most unselfish of human affections&mdash;is a
barrier to <i>real</i> occultism.... While the heart is full of
thoughts for a little group of <i>selves</i>, near and dear to us,
how shall the rest of mankind fare in our souls? What
percentage of love and care will there remain to bestow
on the 'great orphan' [Humanity]? And how shall the
'still small voice' make itself heard in a soul entirely
occupied with its own privileged tenants?... yet,
he who would profit by the wisdom of the universal
mind, has to reach it through <i>the whole of Humanity</i>,
without distinction of race, complexion, religion,
or social status. It is <i>altruism,</i> not <i>ego</i>-ism even in
its most legal and noble conception, that can lead the
unit to merge its little Self in the Universal Selves. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
is to <i>these</i> needs and to this work that the true disciple
of true Occultism has to devote himself if he would
obtain <i>theo</i>-sophy, divine Wisdom and Knowledge.</p>

<p>"The aspirant has to choose absolutely between the
life of the world and the life of Occultism.... It would
be a ceaseless, a maddening struggle for almost any
married man, who would pursue <i>true</i> practical Occultism,
instead of its <i>theoretical</i> philosophy. For he would
find himself ever hesitating between the voice of the
impersonal divine love of Humanity, and that of the
personal, terrestrial love.... Worse than this. For,
<i>whoever indulges, after having pledged himself to</i> OCCULTISM,
<i>in the gratification of a terrestrial love or lust</i>,
must feel an almost immediate result&mdash;that of being
irresistibly dragged from the impersonal divine state
down to the lower plane of matter. Sensual, or even
mental, self-gratification involves the immediate loss
of the powers of spiritual discernment; the voice of the
MASTER can no longer be distinguished from that of
one's passions, or <i>even that of a Dugpa</i>; the right from
wrong; sound morality from mere casuistry. The Dead
Sea fruit assumes the most glorious mystic appearance ...
although it is the intention that decides primarily whether
<i>white</i> or <i>black</i> magic is exercised, yet the results even of
involuntary sorcery cannot fail to be productive of bad
Karma.... <i>Sorcery is any kind of evil influence exercised
upon other persons, who suffer, or make other</i> persons to
suffer, in consequence ... such causes produced have to
call forth effects, and these are evidenced in the just laws
of Retribution.</p>

<p>"Much of this may be avoided if people will only
abstain from rushing into practices neither the nature
nor importance of which they understand.... We are
in the Kali-Yuga and its fatal influence is a thousand-fold
more powerful in the West than it is in the East;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<i>hence the easy preys made by the Powers of the Age of
Darkness in this cyclic struggle, and the many delusions
under which the world is now labouring</i>." (Italics mine&mdash;A.
L. C.)</p>

<p>Applying this high and absolutely uncompromising
moral standard, these grand and stern words, to the two
pseudo-occultists under discussion, it is not difficult&mdash;even
in the light of the little I have already given&mdash;to see
that they themselves, and their actions, bear <i>no sort of
relation</i> to real "Occultism" as here briefly outlined by
H. P. Blavatsky. Their teaching concerning sex is
indeed its antithesis, which inevitably leads to Dugpa-ship,
as H. P. B. definitely states. The issue is clear, and
cannot be evaded or explained away.</p>

<p>It is true that Mrs. Besant started well, even splendidly,
in H. P. B.'s lifetime, and just after her death wrote
a series of simple explanatory manuals which were of
great value to beginners and enquirers. But only two
years later she began, under Brahmin<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> inspiration, to
make serious alterations in H. P. B.'s own works, and
even to throw doubt on her occult knowledge (<i>e.g.</i>, Mrs.
Besant's Preface to the so-called Vol. III of <i>The Secret
Doctrine</i>.) Unfortunately larger and more ambitious
works which followed were vitiated by the same influences,
and I well remember marking many passages in <i>The
Ancient Wisdom</i> which were not in accordance with H. P.
B.'s teachings. But the radical departure from them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
began when Mrs. Besant definitely threw in her lot with
C. W. Leadbeater, the sex pervert, and thereby alienated
and caused such deep sorrow to her former friends and
supporters.<br /><br /></p>

more than ever to sorcery, immorality, and drunkenness. Since then

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Madras" id="Madras"></a>Mrs. Besant's responsibility and the Madras Law-suits.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M.</span> L&eacute;vy's concluding chapter, from which I will
now quote, is obviously written from the heart. He
says that it is his "imperative duty" to resign his
membership in Mrs. Besant's Society, referring to the
pain caused to her old friends by the opinion expressed
by the police court magistrate in the defamation cases ...
for he considered that the facts before him, and the
documentary evidence, supported the view that Mrs.
Besant had known of and even countenanced the practices
of Mr. Leadbeater....</p>

<blockquote><p>"In restoring to Mr. Leadbeater his influence over
herself and over the destinies of the Theosophical Society
[she] has proved her failure in moral vigilance and her lack
of intellectual discrimination as regards methods to which
she thus fails the first victim. And the sorry contradictions
that this brings into her spiritual message, the utter disregard
of truth resulting from this, impel her to words and actions
that now involve an incalculable number of victims, misled
by their devoted trust in her. Her responsibility is in truth
a very terrible one.... I have come to regard the actions
of Mrs. Besant&mdash;and of Mr. Leadbeater equally, of course&mdash;as
the <i>leaven of destruction, of disintegration in the Theosophical
Society</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot rid ourselves of a growing disquiet in seeing
Mrs. Besant, in her monthly articles in the <i>Theosophist</i>,
entitled "On the Watch-Tower," so tirelessly expressing
such great and manifest satisfaction in every smallest material
increase, improvement and enrichment of the Adyar Headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Mr. Leadbeater shares in this joy. Speaking of Mrs.
Besant in the <i>Adyar Album</i>, p. 7, he praises at great length
the material improvements of the Headquarters:&mdash;"In her
reign have been added to the estate no less than six valuable
pieces of property." Thus temporal power would clearly
seem to be the main concern of Adyar. And we involuntarily
turn to the words of Christ, who so well described the spiritual
splendours:&mdash;"My kingdom is not of this world." <i>Not thus
does Mrs. Besant understand spirituality</i> since she "reigns"
as a prince of this world, over a kingdom that grows by her
conquests.... A like concern follows Mr. Leadbeater even
into his occult investigations into the twenty-eighth century,
in which he sees "a kind of gorgeous palace with an enormous
dome, the central part of which must be an imitation of the
Taj Mahal at Agra, but on a much larger scale. In this
great building they mark as memorials certain spots by
pillars and inscriptions, such as ... here such and such a
book was written ... they even have statues of <i>some of us</i>
[<i>sic!!</i>] ...&mdash;<i>Man; Whence, How, and Whither.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Truly may one here repeat the somewhat banal phrase
"Comment is needless"; indeed one might add,
"impossible," in the face of such an amazing manifestation
of megalomania. But this is not the most serious
disease from which C. W. Leadbeater and his colleague
are suffering. As M. L&eacute;vy has already shown, there is
much worse behind of which this megalomania is only
one symptom. In an "Addendum" given at, the end
of his book, M. L&eacute;vy says that since the publication
of his brochure judgment has been pronounced on the
case he mentions (<a href="#Page_29">see p. 29</a>), the judge ruling that the
children should be removed from the care of Mrs. Besant
and given back to the father within a fixed time." He
then continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Further legal proceedings have confirmed, with yet
more precision, the infamous immorality of which Mr. Leadbeater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
stands accused. (see report in <i>The Hindu</i>, Madras,
May 9th, 1913.) A Madras medical review called <i>The Antiseptic</i>
had pubished an article in which apprehension of the
establishment of a 'Temple of Onanism" ["unnatural sin."
See Dr. Hartmann's <i>Paracelsus</i>, p. 90] at Adyar was expressed.
<i>The Hindu</i> newspaper reprinted the scandal. Mrs. Besant
took proceedings aga nst the author of the article and the
publisher of <i>The Antiseptic</i>; and the Treasurer of the
Theosophical Society was moved at the same time to action
against <i>The Hindu</i>. <i>All three cases were dismissed.</i> The
gravity of the position is evident. Mr. Leadbeater's methods
have been proved by his own admissions as well as by documents
before the Court to be subversive of morality....</p>

<p>These facts [I omit the worst details that M. L&eacute;vy feels
obliged to quote] condemn Mr. Leadbeater without possibility
of appeal; they reveal to us, with regard to Mrs. Besant,
a truly degrading complaisance, by reason of her desire to
hide a crime as patent as it is abominable ... the members
of the Theosophical Society are not only kept in complete
ignorance regarding these facts, but the administration of
Adyar, through its extensive propaganda, has a great influence
over new members in all conditions, while concealing and
perverting the truth.... The existence of persons like Mr.
Leadbeater, who admit and practise the worst perversities,
is a sad reminder of the darker side of human nature; yet
the attitude of simply ignoring that such things exist
seems indefensible when these persons pretend to the highest
morality and represent themselves as guides towards spiritual
development ... claiming to stand "on the threshold of
divinity.".. The danger that such persons may continue
to extend their empire over the souls of others is an increasing
one....</p></blockquote>

<p>In view of these "facts" M. L&eacute;vy's restraint of
language is remarkable, his condemnation hardly sufficiently
scathing. His concluding words, however, explain
much; he has evidently greatly admired Mrs. Besant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in earlier years, and the last paragraph of his book
eloquently attests his personal grief:&mdash;"The feeling
which here arrests my pen, and prevents me from saying
more on the matter, will be understood by those who
have followed me so far, and they may hear across my
silence the voice of their own sorrow." I deeply respect
M. L&eacute;vy's feelings; but for me&mdash;who have never had
any illusions regarding Mrs. Besant from the time of the
disruption of the Society in 1894-5&mdash;the matter assumes
a more sinister aspect. His pages have rendered me
most invaluable help in putting before the general public
matter not personally known to my own experience.
I left Colonel Olcott's Society in 1895, M. L&eacute;vy left Mrs.
Besant's in 1913; and when we remember that this was
its condition nine years ago, my previous remarks
(<a href="#Page_14">see p. 14</a>) may be better appreciated now that more
evidence has been adduced<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Central" id="Central"></a>The Central Hindu College. An Indian Criticism.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n a pamphlet published at Benares about the same date
(1913) by Pandit Bhagavan Das, "a former General
Secretary of the Indian Section T. S." we possess still
further evidence of Mrs. Besant's extraordinary aberrations
under C. W. Leadbeater's guidance and control.
Mr. Das's pamphlet is addressed to the editor of the
London <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>, and is entitled "The
Central Hindu College and Mrs. Besant." It is a reply
to some "remarks" by her on this College, which
appeared in that paper in June, 1913. Mr. Das writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[Mrs. Besant's] remarks on the Central Hindu College
[Benares] in your paper are illustrations of this sad change
in her. This Institution, for which she has done more than
anyone else perhaps, she now openly and obviously tries to
injure most deeply in the minds of the public by wild suggestions
that it and the Hindu University, into which it is
proposed to be expanded, are mixed up with political seditionists
and extremists ... that such an educational movement
is in any way mixed up with seditionism and extremism
is an idea ... fatuously ludicrous.... The reckless, incoherent,
self-contradictory, incorrect and misleading statements
that Mrs. Besant has been freely making latterly in
the public press, have only injured her own reputation....
The C. H. C. was founded in July, 1898, in order to do for
the numerous sects and sub-divisions of Hinduism what the
T. S. was endeavouring to do for all views and religions....
The College grew and prospered year by year, under the
Presidentship of Mrs. Besant, and won the confidence ...
of Hindus of almost all shades of opinion.... But with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the transfer of Mrs. Besant from Benares to Adyar in 1907,
as President of the T. S., elected <i>under very peculiar circumstances</i>
[as I learnt recently from a very old member present
in Adyar when Colonel Olcott was on his deathbed. Italics
mine.&mdash;A. L. C.] foreshadowing the coming policies, a change
began to come over the spirit of all her work and surroundings.
Despite the suggestions, advice, entreaties, expostulations,
and warnings of her old colleagues and counsellors <i>who had
made her work in India possible</i> [Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.],
she developed more and more and beyond all due bounds,
the germ of person-worship so long held in restraint. Entirely
proofless claims to superphysical powers and experiences, to
being an Initiate, an Arhat, a Mukta and what not; claims
to read Mars and Mercury and the whole Solar System, past,
present and future (but with careful avoidance of even the
most easy test, such as reading a given page of a closed book)
claims to be the authorised agent of "the Great White
Brotherhood which guides Evolution on earth" and to be
in communication with the Supreme Director of the world
and with "the World-Teacher," etc., in short, all the
elements of sensationalism and emotionalism&mdash;which were
subdominant and private (confined mostly to the "inner"
E. S. T. organisation within the T. S.) now began to be
predominant and public.... In the spring of 1909, a
"brother Initiate" of Mrs. Besant's "discovered" the boy,
now nicknamed Alcyone, as the future vehicle of the Coming
Christ ... <i>"neo-theosophy" was started more or less definitely</i>
[Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.]....</p>

<p>In January 1911 was started publicly by the then
Principal of the C. H. C., as the chief member of the "Group"
an "Order" called The Order of the Rising Sun, with the
idea of "preparing for a coming World-Teacher "as its
publicly avowed central idea, and the creed that the boy
J. K. (Alcyone) would be the "vehicle" of the "Coming
Christ&mdash;Maitreya-Bodhisattva," etc., as its privately understood
creed, to spread which amongst the students was the
duty of the inner "pledged group.' ... [<a href="#Page_21">See <i>ante</i> p. 21</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
In short, Mrs. Besant cleverly utilised an already
existing organisation, founded for quite other objects
and aims, to spread this crazy and pernicious "neo-theosophy,"
under cover of secrecy, pledges, etc., which
she and C. W. Leadbeater&mdash;the real inspirer&mdash;well
knew to be almost irresistible baits for sensitive and
imaginative youths at a highly impressionable age.</p>

<p>In April, 1911, on remonstrance by the older members
of the Managing Committee, Mrs. Besant arranged that the
Order of the Rising Sun should be disbanded. But this was
mere show. When the disbandment was announced to the
managers, it had already been arranged to replace the
O. R. S. on a larger scale by <i>The Order of the Star in the East</i>
with the Principal, Head Master, and various Professors of
the C. H. C. as the Private and other secretaries, of the boy
J. K. as Head of the Order, and Mrs. Besant as Protectress
of the whole....</p>

<p>In the summer of 1911, side by side with this public
activity, there was started by Mrs. Besant <i>within</i> the E. S. T.
<span class="smcap"> ... A WRITTEN PLEDGE OF ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO HERSELF.</span>
This fact, "private and confidential" at the time, is now
public property since the Madras law suits....</p>

<p>In August, 1911, the Trustees of the C. H. C., to allay
the apprehension in the public mind that the C. H. C. was
being diverted from its constitutional broad and liberal
Hinduism into a bizarre and unhealthy personal-cult and
bigoted Second-Adventism, passed formal resolutions to the
effect that the Institution had nothing to do with any such
Orders as those of the <i>Rising Sun</i> or the <i>Star in the East</i>.</p>

<p>On December 24th, 1911, resolutions were passed by
the Trustees, agreeing that the C. H. C. should become part
of the Hindu University.... The neo-theosophic propagandism
within (as without) the C. H. C. continued ...
in a score of evasive and elusive forms. Inner "Groups"
and "Esoteric Section Groups" of persons formally pledged
to obedience to Mrs. Besant, "Leagues of Service" of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
kinds, "Orders of S. E." and "S. I." and "I. L.," "Co-Masonry
Lodges," "Temple of the R. C.," and corresponding
badges, bands, "regalia," "jewels,"and "pink," and "blue,"
and "yellow" scarves; "magnetized ribbons," and "stars"
in pin, brooch, and button forms, etc. [for all the world like
the Kindergarten games for developing infant intelligences!&mdash;A.
L. C.] multiplied and replaced one another in interest
like mushrooms in the rain time, a very fever of restless
sound and movement hiding lack of substance and of wise
purpose. Fuss of the most absurd and mischievous kind
became rampant. Lectures, meetings, night classes, outside
the college rooms and buildings, took place perpetually in
the neighbouring T. S. premises and private residences, for
expounding the doctrines of neo-theosophy and especially the
book called <i>At the Feet of the Master</i> alleged to have been
written down by Alcyone (J. Krishnamurti), as the embryonic
scriptures and revelation of "the Embryo of a New Religion,"
as Mrs. Besant declares the O. S. E. to be. Resident students
were advised, and a number of them began to keep photos
of Alcyone, as the "vehicle" of the "Coming Christ" and
himself an "Initiate of the Great White Brotherhood" (and
Mrs. Besant and one or two other living persons) "on the
threshold of divinity," and to worship them with flowers,
incense, etc. Old and young believers prostrating and genuflecting,
literally, at the feet of the living original when
within reach.... The then Principal of the College (who had
founded the O. R. S.) proclaimed in his lectures in the
neighbouring T. S. Hall, and elsewhere, that he was a "High
Disciple of the Master"; and that the C. H. C. was "founded
to prepare for the Advent of the World-Teacher"....</p>

<p>[Mrs. Besant] has publicly stated [that] all of the members
of the General Council of the T. S. now belong, with one or
two exceptions perhaps, to the "Esoteric Section," prime
condition of membership of which is, <span class="smcap">the formal written
pledge of absolute obedience to Mrs. Besant</span>; and so
while the loud profession is freedom of thought "for all"
the practice is sedulously "for herself," and her pledged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
votaries only; while the theory is that the O. S. E. "must
not be identified with the T. S.," the practice is that the
T. S. must be merged in the O. S. E.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the C. H. C. to bring the narrative up to
date. In March and April 1913 there came into the hands
of another Manager and Trustee, a printed "letter," covering
some three foolscap pages, bearing the signature of the
gentleman who was then Principal of the C. H. C., the date
October 25th, 1912, and the imprint of Mrs. Besant's <i>Vasanta
Press</i>, Adyar, Madras, and not bearing any word like "private"
or "personal," or "confidential." In this "letter" amazingly
extravagant and fantastic statements are made as
regards Mrs. Besant; she is hailed repeatedly as one who is
"<i>to become one of the greatest Rulers of the World of Gods and
men</i>" [This is sheer insanity.&mdash;A. L. C.]; mention is made
of the "recognition of the God without us, which made us
members of this Group from which we draw our life to-day";
it is said "that her light to ours was and is as the rays of
the sun at noon-time to the rays of a lamp at night, and we
did not desire to examine the Sun to see under what conditions
it might possibly ray forth a more dazzling brilliance."
The members of the Group are reminded that "we pledged
ourselves in our hearts that we should strive to become
<i>her true and loyal servants ...,</i>" etc.</p>

<p>Thus complete was the hypnosis and surrender of reason
which was sought to be effected amongst the votaries. It
was a case of emotionalism run amuck...."</p>

<p>It is, unfortunately, "a case" of something infinitely
more mischievous; of evil "magic" and "sorcery"
(cf. H. P. B.'s definition, <a href="#Page_36"><i>ante</i> p. 36</a>.) Whether Mrs.
Besant knows it or not, Mr. Leadbeater undoubtedly
must be well aware that life and strength can be drawn,
on inner planes of being, from the blind devotion of a
solid body of fanatical votaries. "Magicians" of a
certain school&mdash;I need hardly specify which&mdash;thus
prolong their lives through the magnetic and vita
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
emanations of their nearest and most devoted followers.
In a word, it is <i>Vampirism</i>, pure and simple, on the
psychic plane. (I found that Mrs. Tingley well understood
this form of Sorcery.) This, if true in Mrs.
Besant's case is probably unconscious; but in Mr.
Leadbeater's it is done consciously and with knowledge.
That the secret acts and teachings of this man are far
worse than most people have ever suspected is confirmed
in a "Letter in reply to Mrs. Besant" by "Dreamer"
which appeared in <i>The Theosophic Voice</i> (Chicago),
November, 1908, under the title "India Speaks." This
scholarly Hindu Theosophist writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>If we are to believe the stenographic report of the
Inquiry in 1906, then instead of holding that Mr. Leadbeater
denied the charges, we must come to the conclusion that not
only did he teach the solitary vice, but further he did things
which would have brought him within the pale of the criminal
laws for the foulest and most indecent offence which brute
man may commit. This is our latter day saint who must
be re-admitted, nay, invited back, into the Theosophical
Society.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that this was written fourteen years ago!
The subject is a revolting one, but in the interests of that
public whom these people are still misleading and deceiving,
and who have no idea of the extreme gravity of
the menace, it is necessary to be explicit.</p>

<p>To return to the "Letter" mentioned by Mr. Das;
he continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The Trustee and Manager into whose hands a copy of
the astonishing document came, with the information that
<i>it had been circulated</i> amongst a number of the C. H. C.
students, informed the secretaries of the College, and sent
the letter with the comments on the same for publication
in a daily paper, in order to show the public how the person-worship-creeds
of Mrs. Besant's "neo-theosophy" were being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
sown and grown within the C. H. C. despite the resolutions
of the Trustees.</p>

<p>On publication of the rhapsody, a great outcry in the
name of "injured innocence" was raised.... As to the
"dishonourableness" of the publication, competent judges of
such matters have pronounced that it was dishonourable
only if it be dishonourable to expose what cannot be called
other than <i>gross treason</i> to the Constitution and ideals of
the C. H. C., and to bring to light, and the bar of public
opinion, underhand or half-concealed or openly defiant efforts
to convert students to a grotesque person-worship and
demoralizing and soul-stunting blind obedience to Mrs.
Besant.... The asking for, and the receiving of the pledges
of obedience to herself, etc., is an act of over-weening presumption
against the God in every man.... Ever since she
encouraged and started them, her mind has worked less
and less correctly and confusion has fallen ever worse and
worse upon her work, losing to the T. S. many thousands
of old members, alienating from her all her old co-workers
and co-founders of the C. H. C. and destroying the confidence
in her of the Indian public.</p></blockquote>

<p>Towards the end of his most illuminating pamphlet
Mr. Das has occasion to speak of Mrs. Besant's "wildly
reckless statements," some of which he quotes. They
relate to the C. H. C. and he stigmatises them as "<i>all
simply and utterly untrue</i>." "Her mind," he says a
little further on, is working "incoherently." Finally, he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Let us conclude; when a person like Mrs. Besant, with
a biography full of remarkable changes, full of fine work
as well as bad blunders, having established herself, in her
own belief, and that of her pledged band, as the present
chief Spiritual Teacher and Saviour of Mankind, as "the
God within us" now, and as the future "greatest Ruler of
the World of Gods and men," suddenly adds on the role of
political saviour of India in particular, and pre-determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
martyr in constant danger of assassination [strangely enough,
this was also one of Mrs. Tingley's obsessions] by anarchist
miscreants ... and proclaims that those who differ from
her are in league with those miscreants&mdash;when this happens,
what explanation can be offered to their own minds by her
old friends ...?</p>

<p>The only sad explanation that they can postulate is
that she is suffering from mental delusions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alas! this lenient and charitable judgment by no
means covers the ground as a complete explanation of
Mrs. Besant's mischievous and almost irresponsible
activities. Mr. Das fails to see as clearly as MM. L&eacute;vy
and Schur&eacute; the sinister influence behind all these manifestations;
the source and inspiration of all this evil.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Claims" id="Claims"></a>Mrs. Besant's latest Assertions and claims examined.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E now come to the examination of two articles
in the <i>Theosophist</i> for March, 1922, in which the
President of the T. S. makes some attempt to deal
with recent criticism. One is a Supplement, or Manifesto,
addressed "To all Members of the Theosophical Society,"
and couched in Mrs. Besant's present style&mdash;flamboyant,
a trifle bombastic, often Biblical in phraseology, and
running throughout it, her usual fervid and disingenuous
appeal to sentimental emotionalism, instead of the
instinctive sense of justice latent in all beings. This
latter, a feature of her best days, she has entirely
abandoned; it no longer serves her ends. What those
"ends" are one almost hesitates to formulate,
so impious and almost insane do they appear. Even
taking into consideration the tangled mass of evasions,
misstatements and hypocritical equivocations presented
in this manifesto, these "ends" emerge with sufficient
clearness. But, in the first place, and before going
further, one must ask on what basis this amazing claim
to almost deific powers and knowledge rests. Let me
here call M. L&eacute;vy into the witness box once more; for
he also had put the same question to himself nine years
ago, and will provide the answer. It occurs in his
chapter on "Mrs. Besant's 'Return of the Christ,'"
where he is dealing with her position and actions in regard
to Dr. Steiner, the German occultist and Christian
Theosophist&mdash;with whose ideas, I should add, I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in personal agreement. My teacher is H. P. Blavatsky
and she alone: I follow no lesser light. M. L&eacute;vy
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Our reason forces us to confess that all goes to suggest
that Mrs. Besant, having herself ceased to believe in the
identity of her Jesus with the Christ [of the Gospels.&mdash;A. L. C.],
would still continue to make others believe it.... Her pride
... her dominating mind, have driven her on this crusade
of extermination of Dr. Steiner's teachings; it has induced
her to collect, <i>without the least regard for truth, justice, or
theosophic principles, no matter what weapons if they do but
serve against her opponent; calumny, abuse of power, misstatement
of facts, all combined in a subtle strategy</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Italics are mine; for we find Mrs. Besant using
precisely the same methods to-day, only in a form
fortunately neither so "subtle" nor so Jesuitically
plausible. Her powers are failing, as the manifesto
under consideration clearly proves. M. L&eacute;vy proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>And when she falls victim of some error in the course
of her occult investigations&mdash;of which in theory she is always
proclaiming the fallibility&mdash;it is again her pride that bars
the way to admission, and makes her the slave of the most
pitiful machinations ... which ... will shatter to fragments
in all directions the confidence she had formerly
inspired. For if she is not consciously defending her mistake,
then what kind of a break-up of all her faculties are we
witnessing?... The more deeply we study this [<i>i.e.</i>, the
"neo-theosophy" already described by M. L&eacute;vy and Pandit
Bhagavan Das.&mdash;A. L. C.], the more terrible appear the
responsibilities of Adyar in this deplorable scheme; for we
would still seek the origin of such fearless confidence [in
Mrs. Besant's followers.&mdash;A. L. C.] refusing, as it does, to
be shaken by the eloquent appeal of the facts here set forth,
and of which some, if not all, have been within the reach
and open to examination of those members who profess such
an enthusiastic confidence in Mrs. Besant. The result of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
our search is a yet further culpability, as overwhelming as
it is unexpected.</p>

<p>For this confidence is not in the case of all the victims
the result of the free use of their own inner faculties. It is
in the case of the greater number, due to the influence of a
strong suggestion <i>deliberately organised and cleverly carried out
by the authors of this mystification themselves; by Mr. Leadbeater
who wrote, and by Mrs. Besant who published</i>, the following
lines in the <i>Adyar Album</i>, p. 45: "What can I say to you
of your President that you do not know already? Her
colossal [<i>sic</i>] intellect, her unfailing wisdom, her unrivalled
eloquence, her splendid forgetfulness of self, her untiring
devotion to work for others&mdash;all these are familiar to you.
Yet these qualities, these powers, are but a small part of
her greatness; they are on the surface, they may be seen
by all, they leap to the eyes. But there are other qualities,
other powers, of which you cannot know, because they
pertain to the secrets of Initiation. She is a pupil of our
Masters; from the fount of Their archaic wisdom she derives
her own, the plans which she is carrying out are Their plans
for the welfare of the world. Think, therefore, how great an
honour it is for you that you should be permitted to work
under her, for in doing so you are virtually working under
Them. Think how watchful you should be to miss no hint
which falls from her lips, to carry out exactly whatever
instructions she may give you. Remember that because of
her position as an Initiate she knows far more than you do;
and precisely because her knowledge is occult, given under
the seal of Initiation, she cannot share it with you. Therefore
her actions must certainly be governed by considerations of
which you have no conception. There will be times when
you cannot understand her motives, for she is taking into
account many things which you cannot see and of which
she must not tell you. But whether you understand or not,
you will be wise to follow her implicitly, just because she
knows. This is no mere supposition on my part, no mere
flight of the imagination; I have stood beside your President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in the presence of the Supreme Director of evolution on this
globe, and I know whereof I speak. Let the wise hear my
words, and act accordingly."</p>

<p>It is easy to see how minds not gifted with a highly
developed critical faculty, or the instinctive sense that
discriminates the true from the false, would yield hopelessly
to such a formidable assault. They cannot see that he who
thus guarantees the infallibility of Mrs. Besant has himself
need of guarantee.... <i>I do not think that any religion or
man-made cult, even in the earliest ages, has ever promulgated
superstition in its grossest form so openly and boldly as this ...</i>
[Italics mine.&mdash;A.L.C.]. Mr. Leadbeater ... demands
<i>deliberate</i> suppression of thought.... And having extolled
such a deliberately induced mental torpor for Mrs. Besant's
benefit, he immediately demands it for himself when he
speaks of the "Supreme Director of evolution on this globe."
Who is this administrative person? With whom is he to
be identified in the scheme of evolution as it has been given
to us by Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater themselves?...
What avenging God will come to confound this impious
prophet who seeks to reduce humanity to the level of a
troop of obedient automata!... A gentle and winning
voice, infinitely reassuring, rises out of the depths of my
being ... a great light breaks forth, triumphant. Mr.
Leadbeater hears the words of a judgment immediate and
without appeal, pronounced by the Buddha himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe not what you have heard said; believe not in
traditions merely because they have been transmitted through
many generations; believe not merely because a thing is
repeated by many persons; ... believe not conjectures ...
<i>believe not solely upon the authority of your Masters and elders</i>.
<span class="smcap">When upon observation and analysis a principle conforms
to reason and leads to the benefit and welfare of
all, accept it and hold it.</span>"&mdash;(Buddha, <i>Anguttura Nikaya</i>.)</p>

<p>What a royal refuge, what a noble support are the words
of those who are the truly great! They are the perpetual
safeguard of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
We have seen that upon "observation and analysis"
the "unfailing" wisdom of Mrs. Besant is no more than
a mass of inconsistencies, injustices, sectarian tactics in
administration, error and mystification in esoteric announcements.
Far from leading to "the benefit and welfare of all,"
this "unfailing" wisdom is leading to the ... most miserable
slavery of souls, the emasculation of minds, the creation
of a terrible heresy. And at the present time we are all
feeling that we shall not be living up to the wise exhortations
of that great Being who was the Buddha, unless we clearly
denounce the lamentable aberrations of these two occultists
in the hope of drawing all the souls we possibly can away
from their pernicious influence. With this end in view, and
faithful to this duty, we shall calmly and firmly continue
our investigation of facts.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the assertions of Mrs. Besant and Mr.
Leadbeater have lately reached to such a pitch of extravagance
and have so utterly defied common sense that they will
rouse even the least critical minds and the most compliant
hearts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows the section of M. L&eacute;vy's book in which
he quotes from <i>Man; Whence, How, and Whither</i>;
much of this I have given earlier in this pamphlet. And
M. L&eacute;vy, one must remember, wrote all this <i>nine years
ago</i>!</p>

<p>At this point it may serve a useful purpose if I
specifically define my own position in regard to Mrs.
Besant's claims. <i>I entirely and most emphatically reject
them all.</i> Mr. Leadbeater's I was not even aware of,
until I came to collect and examine the material for this
pamphlet. They are so monstrous as not even to merit a
specific "rejection"&mdash;it goes without saying. I practically
lost all faith in Mrs. Besant when she dissimulated
and tried to mislead the Inner Group Council on her
return from her first visit to India in 1894. She then
informed us that she had been "ordered by the Master to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
accuse Judge." On being closely cross-examined,
however, she finally admitted that she had not received
this "Order" <i>direct</i>, as she would have had us believe,
but <i>through</i> the Brahmin whom she then followed
blindly<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, exactly as she now follows Leadbeater.
But later, when taxed with this in public, she pretended
that he had had nothing whatever to do with it! This
is a typical example of Mrs. Besant's idea of a 'truthful'
statement in a matter of the most vital importance
involving the fate of a leader and many thousands of
members. What confidence can be placed in such a
woman&mdash;one whose mental processes are so warped, and
whose ideas of 'truth' and 'honesty' are so peculiar?
To inspire confidence a leader must be the very soul of
truth and uprightness. Mrs. Besant has always been
remarkable for asserting herself to be this, and people
have believed her. But a truly upright and honest
person (even if aware of it, as in Occultism he has to be)
would never draw attention to it&mdash;and that publicly
and in print.</p>

<p>Because, for Mrs. Besant, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was <i>at
this period</i> her mouthpiece for the Master, she expected
her colleagues to take the same view without question.
This attitude is typical, and can be applied to all that she
now says about Leadbeater (<a href="#Page_19">see <i>ante</i> p. 19</a>.) From
this time I found it impossible to believe in her or her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
statements; such, for instance, as that H. P. B. had
reincarnated in Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s little daughter!!<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;or
in anyone else for that matter. H. P. B. herself,
when someone asked her about reincarnating, jokingly
replied&mdash;"Yes, in some mild Hindu youth with half a
lobe to his brain!" <i>H. P. B. has not reincarnated.</i> On
the ridiculous belief above mentioned Mrs. Besant based
her "authority" for doing things in H. P. B.'s name after
her death (<a href="#Tampering">see <i>post</i> p. 71 for examples</a>). It follows also
that I absolutely reject her claim to be an "agent"
of the Masters (<i>i.e.</i>, the Trans-Him&acirc;layan Brotherhood),
neither do I believe that she has had any communication
whatsoever with Them since H. P. B.'s death.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Finally,
I reject her most presumptuous claim that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
is able, or in anyway fitted, to "expand," "verify,"
or "check" by psychic faculties H. P. B.'s statements
and teachings; still less to carry on independent occult
investigations on the same, or any similar plane of
consciousness. Whether Mrs. Besant, in making these
claims, is acting under the glamour of Mr. Leadbeater's
"clairvoyant" delusions, as MM. L&eacute;vy and Schur&eacute;  suggest, or is fully conscious and responsible, is not my
part to judge, nor does it really matter. For me, her
life may be summed up in some words she applied
recently to Mr. Gandhi (<i>Theosophist</i>, April, 1922). It is
"the tragedy of a soul." Her criticisms on what she calls
his "failure" apply fully and literally to <i>her own</i>.</p>

<p>There is really very little in the Manifesto (<i>Theosophist</i>,
March, 1922), that is not sufficiently answered
by the various extracts I have quoted from previous
critics. Mrs. Besant opens with the usual disingenuous
statements about the "Liberal Catholic Church." Her
argument that all religions are on an equal footing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
T. S. carries no weight when it is widely known that
L. C. C. agents are everywhere at work pushing its
interests.</p>

<p>Coming next to Mr. Leadbeater, Mrs. Besant states
that he was "cleared by a Committee in England"!
But it is really a little too much, and altogether too
brazen,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> when she dares to compare his case with that
of H. P. B. in the matter of slander. <i>There can be no
possible comparison.</i> The worst ever suggested against
H. P. B. was what has been said of many other women,
including Mrs. Besant herself, who have had to work
in the glare of publicity and champion an unpopular
cause. No evidence was ever brought forward, and the
New York <i>Sun</i> promptly apologised for publishing
such statements on being shown that they were
unfounded.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The grave charges against Mr. Leadbeater
were supported by documentary evidence <i>which has
never been rebutted</i>, and they have to do with something
far worse than personal moral laxity, as we have seen.
Mrs. Besant knows she cannot meet these charges,
and so seeks to brush them aside by voluble talk about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"hatred," "defamation," and "vilification." The only
<i>justification</i> she offers for having reinstated him in 1907
is that she had discovered that it was "a cruel lie
that he had confessed to wrongdoing"! This is to
argue that the "accused" should be "acquitted"
because he refused to confess&mdash;in the face of evidence
of no matter how damning a nature! Did Mrs. Besant
follow this procedure in her "Case against W. Q. Judge"?
Not at all; far from "acquitting" him when he refused
to "confess to wrongdoing" and asked for production
of the incriminating documents, she calmly confessed
that she had destroyed them! But <i>now</i> that it is a
case of her own guide and "intermediary" in the dock,
her attitude is entirely different, and it is quite enough
for her that the "accused" did not "confess" his
crime!</p>

<p>As Dr. Stokes, Editor of the <i>O. E. Critic</i> (Washington,
D.C.) has been fearlessly stating the facts and encouraging
the "Back to Blavatsky" movement for some time past,
she next devotes a paragraph to an attempt to discredit
him by suggesting his connection with an old enemy
of H. P. B.'s. Dr. Stokes's championship of H. P. B.,
and relentless exposure of the Besant-Leadbeater imposture
is the more effective since he persists in retaining
his membership in the T. S.</p>

<p>The next to be dealt with is Pandit Bhagavan Das,
and his criticisms about the Central Hindu College.
Here again, all I have quoted from his pamphlet about
the secret sections, underhand work, pledges, etc., are
entirely ignored.</p>

<p>Mr. T. H. Martyn's letter, which has caused such a
sensation in the Society (Holland alone asking for 500
copies) is dismissed as full of "untrue" statements.
Truly a very simple method of dealing with matter
which Mrs. Besant finds compromising or unpleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
(<a href="#Page_18">see <i>ante</i> p. 18</a>); but she can hardly believe it to be
convincing.</p>

<p>It is when this profoundly disingenuous woman
comes to an explanation of the motive behind her political
work in India, that we find a typical specimen of the
peculiar form of megalomania already so ably demonstrated
by M. L&eacute;vy. What must be the mental condition
of a person who can sit down and solemnly write the
following?</p>

<blockquote><p>The work entrusted to me directly by the great Rishi
who is&mdash;as one may say [<i>sic</i>]&mdash;the spiritual Viceroy<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> for
India of the King of Kings of our world&mdash;is the bringing
about of Home Rule in India, in close union with Great
Britain, as part of a great Federation of Free Nations, a
model of the future World Commonwealth...."</p></blockquote>


<p>Why such a very mundane and political idea should
need an order from a Rishi is not explained. The patent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
appeal both to the Government and the Indian people
in this portentous announcement is not very happily
conceived.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate for Mrs. Besant that her indignant
denial that another of the notorious "Bishops"
(Wedgwood) is "wanted" by the police was
immediately followed by a priest's confession and the
Bishop's resignation from the L. C. C., the T. S., and the
Co-masons!<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>


<p>Finally we come to the most ominous part of the
whole document, where Mrs. Besant refers to the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
condition of the sex problem, and indicates that Mr.
Leadbeater's vile teachings to, and practices with boys&mdash;trying
"to wean lads from evil practices" is her version
of it&mdash;are part of a process necessary "to save mankind
in the near future." The "lessening of the sex impulse"
on the "line of higher mental evolution" is "too slow."
"Early marriage and birth-control"&mdash;preceded, one
must assume, by Leadbeaterism&mdash;are now Mrs. Besant's
inspired panaceas.</p>

<p>The appalling menace to <i>the evolution of the spiritual
nature in man</i>, of the secret Leadbeater teaching known
as the "X-system," is shown by the evidence of
Dr. Eleanor M. Hiestand-Moore (M.D.), Editor of the
<i>Theosophic Voice</i> (Chicago), in which all the Leadbeater
proceedings of 1906 were reported and discussed.
In the August number, 1908, Dr. Hiestand-Moore
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>During the winter of 1906-7 the Editor [herself] was
in Chicago and in order to combat the widespread tendency
to uphold self-abuse on the lines indicated by Mr. Leadbeater,
a series of lectures on the psychology of sex was given. There
were members in the E. S., and out of it who upheld the
X-system. One person declared ... that <i>this system would,
before many years, be taught in our public schools</i>. Still
another insisted that <i>by self-abuse humanity was to return to
the hermaphroditic type</i> and that <i>this practice would be universal
among Fifth Round Humanity</i>. A number declared that,
while they did not pretend to know anything about such
matters, they had understood this was <i>a highly occult teaching
given to would-be disciples</i>! We could lay hands on a letter
setting forth the claim that this teaching is purely "esoteric"
and not to be estimated by exoteric standards&mdash;this, too,
from a Branch president! [Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.].</p>

<p>These instances are sufficiently appalling in themselves.
But what can we say now that <i>The Voice</i> has elicited a correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
which is simply a brazen defence of these
"teachings"?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>What, then, must be the moral condition of this
horrible travesty of the old T.S. <i>now</i>, fourteen years after
Dr. Hiestand-Moore wrote the foregoing? Mrs. Besant
is thus seen to have now returned practically to the Neo-Malthusianism
of her earlier, pre-theosophic association
with the late Charles Bradlaugh. It may not be generally
known that H. P. B. <i>refused to accept her as a pupil</i> until
she had published a recantation of all she and Bradlaugh
had advocated in <i>The Fruits of Philosophy</i>. It is a
sinister omen that under C. W. Leadbeater, the sex
pervert, Mrs. Besant has abandoned H. P. Blavatsky's
imperative requirement for becoming a student of <i>White</i>
Occultism, and has returned to the essentially materialistic
doctrine of "birth-control," in direct contravention of
the true Occult teaching. In other words, her assertion
amounts to this:&mdash;<i>Self</i>-control is not possible (or is
"too slow "), therefore we must control <i>results</i>. How
different is the Occult teaching is well-known to all
who have taken the trouble to read H. P. B.'s articles
from which I have already quoted (<a href="#Occultism">see <i>ante</i> p. 31</a>) and
the splendid chapter in Vol. II of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i>
entitled "The Curse from a Philosophical Point of View."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
And H. P. B. told me herself that she included the
following verse in <i>The Voice of the Silence</i> with the
express object of combating such teachings and placing
the Occult doctrine beyond possibility of misinterpretation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not believe that lust can ever be killed out if
gratified or satiated, for this is an abomination inspired
by M&acirc;ra. It is by feeding vice that it expands and
waxes strong, like to the worm that fattens on the
blossom's heart."</p>

<p>In a note H. P. B. explains that M&acirc;raacirc;ra is "personified
temptation through men's vices, and translated literally
means 'that which kills' the Soul." Far from "saving"
mankind, therefore, these professed 'expanders' and
'expounders' of H. P. B.'s doctrines are in reality doing
their best to hasten its end. Better far, from the Occult
standpoint, that a race should be wiped out by "outraged
Nature," as were the Atlanteans for the same sins, than
that it should be kept alive only to sink lower and lower
until "M&acirc;ra" kills its Soul.</p>

<p>In the "Watch-Tower" (<i>Theosophist</i>, March, 1922,)
Editorial mention is made of a display at Adyar of
"treasures of the most varied kinds," which have just
been unearthed from "all the old locked-up boxes"
at the headquarters. Why, one may not unreasonably
enquire, has Mrs. Besant waited until 1922 to disinter,
for instance, a long and valuable letter from H. P. B.
herself? Why have such "treasures" been <i>kept back
for over thirty years</i>; just as "Letters" from the Masters
(the Trans-Him&acirc;layan Brotherhood) were kept hidden
away for an even longer period&mdash;nearly forty years?
The reasons are so ridiculously transparent that they
would hardly deceive an intelligent child. Mrs. Besant
is becoming seriously discomposed, even alarmed, by the
growing strength of the "Back to Blavatsky" movement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
which is in itself a reaction against her own neglect.
Hence all this "burrowing" (her own word)
in order to make a brave show of these "treasures"
for which she had no sort of use until, disturbed by
alarming rumours, she hastily resorts to them for
purposes of camouflage and disguise. For she is a
skilful opportunist and clever actress, assuming successive
parts with as convincing an air as any "star";
neither does she scruple to employ every device of the
party politician.</p>

<p>Does Mrs. Besant seriously believe that this attempt
to drag the red herring of an unexplained and suddenly
awakened interest in these "treasures" across the trail
of Mr. Leadbeater's infamies will deceive anyone save
their blind and infatuated followers? Has she forgotten
that when, <i>only two years</i> after H. P. Blavatsky's death,
she came under the direct hypnotic control of Brahmin
influence, she threw doubts upon her old Teacher's <i>bona
fides</i> and her occult knowledge; and, in the course of
formulating her charges against her fellow-disciple (a
<i>chela</i> of many years' standing before she ever even heard
of Theosophy) suggested to Mr. Judge that, "<i>misled by
a high example</i>" (H. P. B.), he had fallen "a victim."
For, as she then told him, her "theory was <i>first</i>, that
H. P. B. had committed several frauds for good ends and
made bogus messages; <i>second</i>, that [he] was misled by
her example; and <i>third</i>, that H. P. B. had given [him]
permission to do such acts. She then," continues Mr.
Judge, "asked me to confess thus, and that would
clear up all. I peremptorily denied such a horrible lie,
and warned her that everywhere I would resist such
attack on H. P. B. These are the facts, and the real
issue is around H. P. B." (<i>The Path</i>, March, 1895.)</p>

<p>With the complete disruption of the Society the
Brahmin period of dominance over Mrs. Besant came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to an end. Then followed the Leadbeater <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, the
first phase of which culminated in the crisis of 1906.
But on Colonel Olcott's death in the following year, she
contrived the realisation of her great ambition, and
became President of the Society. At this point in her
career, however, there were two serious difficulties which
she had to meet:&mdash;<i>first</i>, the Leadbeater scandal which
raised a storm of horror and protest from those old and
tried members who had remained in the Society up to
that time, but who then practically withdrew in a body
Deprived of their support, and having reinstated the
infamous Leadbeater, Mrs. Besant realised that, as
President, she could no longer risk appearing half-hearted
over H. P. Blavatsky; nay more, she <i>needed</i>
the support of her venerated name; <i>second</i>, as President
of the Society created by H. P. B., she must, for the sake
of her own prestige, take some definite action which
would remove all possibility of suspicion that she was
no longer the follower of the Teacher whom she had,
<i>in fact</i>, already "denied" and "betrayed" only two
years after her death. Mrs. Besant realised, in short,
that she had gone too far, and must now retrieve the
position. Accordingly, in 1907, she issued a pamphlet
entitled <i>H. P. Blavatsky and the Masters of the [sic]
Wisdom</i>, in which, with all her accustomed ability, she
dealt once more with the famous (or rather infamous)
Report of the Society for Psychical Research, published
in 1885. But the concluding eulogy strikes a false note,
coming from one who, as I have shown, was capable of
being persuaded that H. P. B. had concocted messages
from those Masters Whom she so faithfully served for
two-thirds of her life.</p>

<p>It was at this time also (1907), so Mrs. Besant later
declared, that "the T. S. fully regained its original
position, with the Masters of the [<i>sic</i>] Wisdom as once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
more the 'First Section' of the Society." This
bold assertion was made in 1919, when, under
pressure of some fresh scare connected with Mr. Leadbeater,
Mrs. Besant published a small volume of the
Masters' Letters (most of which had presumably been
lying in the archives of the Society at Adyar for nearly
forty years!), obviously for no other reason than because
among them are two alleged to have been received by
Mr. Leadbeater. This she did in order to bolster up
the extravagant claims she now makes for him as a
"Great Teacher." But there were many who received
Letters in the early days, and there is no reason why
similar claims should not be made for all the recipients!</p>

<p>In the article entitled "Whom will ye Serve?"
(<i>Theosophist</i>, March, 1922,) Mrs. Besant says that H. P.
B. "formed an inner circle of her pupils, that it might
bear witness to the truth and reality of the inner side
of life." This was the "Inner Group" of which she
and I were two of the six women members. But as,
unfortunately Mr. Leadbeater was not included, although
he had become a member of the T. S. some years before,
she adds:&mdash;"And behold! ere she passed away, she had
led others to the Light, and bade them bear witness
to it...." Considering that she "passed away" <i>less
than a year</i> after forming the Inner Group in the summer
of 1890, and that we were constantly with her and
never heard of these "others," this statement is manifestly
untrue. Mrs. Besant also refers to Mr. Leadbeater
as "one of H. P. B.'s nearest and most trusted pupils
[Absolutely untrue.&mdash;A. L. C.] whom she had led to
his Master of many lives, and in whom she had awakened
the powers since so splendidly used in the service of the
Society that he might become a great Teacher...."</p>

<p>I challenge Mrs. Besant to produce anything in
writing by H. P. B. to warrant this audacious assertion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
I was a pupil of H. P. B. (and through her was accepted
as "a <i>chela</i> on probation," in 1889) before Mrs. Besant
joined the T. S., and saw her expel one of her most
gifted and valued workers from the Esoteric Section for
offences against the occult and moral law similar to
those with which Mr. Leadbeater's name has now been
associated for nearly twenty years. H. P. B. was
always extremely strict on this particular point, and
many would-be aspirants for <i>chelaship</i> were refused on
this one ground alone, while others who had been
accepted "on probation" failed almost immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>When I joined the T. S. in 1885 my diploma was
signed by Colonel Olcott as President and C.W. Leadbeater
as Secretary (he was then at Adyar), but I never
heard him mentioned by H. P. B. or anyone else at
the London Headquarters, as a person of any importance
whatever, in the occult sense. Mrs. Besant goes on to
say that H. P. B. left "the twain of us [Leadbeater
and herself] to bear personal witness to the truth when
she had gone"! Where is her <i>evidence</i> that Mr. Leadbeater
was ever one of H. P. B.'s pupils? There is
none, save this bare, unsupported assertion of a highly
interested party. How could these two, to the exclusion
of all H. P. B.'s pupils&mdash;some of them "regularly
accepted <i>chelas</i> on probation"&mdash;be specially selected,
taught, and prepared, (and above all, to promulgate
the sort of "teachings" of which I have given a few
specimens), without any of us hearing even a hint
of it! Moreover, I never saw, or even heard of Mr.
Leadbeater at the London Headquarters while H. P. B.
was alive. I might just as well claim such a mission for
myself, or Mr. Mead, or Dr. Keightley, or any other
member of the Inner Group who has remained true to
the pledge and the Teacher; and with greater justice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
for Mrs. Besant has <i>not</i>. The truth is that Mr. Leadbeater
was never heard of in connection with occult
teaching until he was taken up and foisted on the
unfortunate T. S. and E. S. as a "Great Teacher" by
Mrs. Besant who was herself never more than a "<i>chela</i>
on probation"&mdash;<i>during H. P. B.'s lifetime</i>.</p>

<p>Let me refer again to H. P. B.'s article "The
Theosophical Mahatmas" from which I have already
quoted (<a href="#Page_3"><i>ante</i> p. 3</a>), in which she deals with the members
of the T. S. who were "regularly accepted <i>chelas</i> on
probation," and the subsequent failure of nearly all of
them. If this was true at that time, it can certainly
now be applied to the case of Mrs. Besant, who, in my
judgment and that of many others, conspicuously failed
under two great tests. The first failure occurred when
she went to India in 1893, became an orthodox Hindu,
and was induced to entertain those doubts of her Teacher
that I have already alluded to. (<a href="#Page_66"><i>ante</i> p. 66</a>.) Bound up
with this failure&mdash;the doubt of the Teacher&mdash;was her
attack on her fellow <i>chela</i>, Mr. Judge.</p>

<p>The second failure was a far worse one when, in
1906, after having publicly endorsed the finding of the
Advisory Committee on Leadbeater's crimes (<a href="#Footnote_14_14">see footnote
<i>ante</i> p. 59</a>), she suddenly turned round and secured his
reinstatement. In thus condoning and even endorsing
immorality of the vilest description, she denied one of
the strictest occult laws binding upon a <i>chela</i>.</p>

<p>This double failure had far more serious results in
her case than in those of which H. P. B. wrote in 1886,
because, owing to her commanding position as a leader,
the fate of the many thousands of earnest souls in the
Society who believed in and followed her implicitly,
was involved.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This Brahmin is the person referred to in the following passage
from Mr. T. H. Martyn's letter to Mrs. Besant of May 20th, 1921
(<a href="#Page_18">see <i>ante</i> p. 18</a>):&mdash;"Like many of the older members I have known
how you and others for quite a long time regarded &mdash;&mdash; as
<i>a Master in the flesh</i> and later had to repudiate him when certain
facts indicated the mistake." Italics mine. This is absolutely new
to me. In 1894 none of us (so far as I was then aware) regarded
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; as anything more than a <i>chela</i>, so what Mr. Martyn
here states must have been a later development, and explains much.
</p><p>
I suppress the gentleman's name out of regard for his present
official position in India and his dissociation from Mrs. Besant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> I did not learn the actual facts of this foolish fable until I
came to India in 1918, and found they were common knowledge
among leading members of that time. Naturally, when Mrs. Besant
transferred her allegiance to Mr. Leadbeater, she had to find another
"body" for H. P. B. So, in the <i>Theosophist</i> for January, 1922. she
writes the following typical effusion for the benefit of the faithful:&mdash;" ... alas!
she passed away, and took rebirth in the north of India,
and though we have lived for twenty-eight years in the same land
so dear to beth of us, we have never met physically face to face. Yet
close ties bind us to each other, and may be we shall yet greet each
other in the flesh." Observe the suggestion that she has always
been in close touch with H. P. B. <i>out of the body</i>, and that later they
may meet "in the flesh." This prepares the ground for producing
this new "incarnation" when the suitable moment comes; just as
the boy Krishnamurti was brought forward as the "body" for the
coming "World-Teacher." Mrs. Besant's new version must be
amusing reading for those familiar with the earlier theory, as she
was certainly "face to face" with the "little daughter" constantly,
and even persuaded Countess Wachtmeister to resume her former
care of H. P. B. in her new body. Needless to say the poor Countess
was sadly disillusioned, and died not long afterwards bitterly bewailing
the ruin of the T. S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> As showing the absurdity of such a claim, I may mention
that Mrs. Besant actually visited mediums through whom H. P. B.
was supposed to communicate. In 1892, only a year after her death,
my colleague Mr. Basil Crump, Barrister-at-Law, was investigating
the phenomena of a certain trance medium shortly before he joined
the T. S. He was present at a private sitting with this medium in
the studio of an artist friend, to which Mrs. Besant came with another
member of H. P. B.'s Inner Group, Miss Emily Kislingbury,
in order to speak with her deceased teacher. An intelligence calling
itself "Madame Blavatsky" controlled the medium, and Mrs. Besant
held a conversation with it. Later, when Mr. Crump became acquainted
with H. P. B.'s explanation of Spiritualistic phenomena, and her
express denial that the true immortal Ego ever communicated in this
manner, he was naturally astonished that one of her most learned
pupils should for a moment entertain such a possibility and waste
her valuable time in attending a s&eacute;ance. But now he sees that it
was only an early symptom of the astounding credulity and ignorance
of occult science she has since exhibited, as shown in these pages.
H. P. B.'s explanations of psychic phenomena are rapidly being
endorsed and followed by the modern scientific school of investigation,
which has succeeded not only in proving the genuineness of the
phenomena, but also the important part played by the <i>will and
imagination</i> both of the medium and the sitters in their production.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Her latest move, is to draw a distinction between the "Advisory
Committee of 1906" which she accuses of "unjust action," and what
she calls "the prolonged investigation of 1907-08," which of course
was engineered by her after she became President, in order to white-wash
Mr. Leadbeater and secure his reinstatement. (See <i>Theosophist</i>,
July, 1922). <a href="#Australian">See Addendum</a> for the Australian views on this.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The importance of this case lies in the fact that it constituted
an absolute vindication of H. P. B., for every slander ever circulated
directly or indirectly was covered by it. Although the libel action
came to an end with her death, the paper was so impressed by the
evidence produced, in rebuttal, by Mr. Judge, that it not only
retracted all that it had published, but also invited Mr. Judge to
write a long article entitled "The Esoteric She" which they said
"disposes of all questions relating to Madame Blavatsky." That
Mrs. Asquith and Count Witte should both have seen fit to revive
some of these old slanders in their books of reminiscences does not
redound to their credit.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Mrs. Besant's "Spiritual Viceroy" has certainly nothing to
do with Those who were directing H. P. B. when she founded the
Indian T. S. <span class="smcap">OR</span> U. B. in 1879; for a special clause was included in
the Constitution stating that "The Society repudiates all interference
on its behalf with the Governmental relations of any nation or community,
confining its attention exclusively to the matters set forth
in the present document...." H. P. B. also wrote in the <i>Theosophist</i>,
for October, 1879&mdash;"Unconcerned about politics; hostile to the
insane dreams of Socialism and Communism, which it abhors&mdash;as
both are but disguised conspiracies of brutal force and sluggishness
against honest labour; the Society cares but little about the outward
human management of the material world. The whole of its aspirations
are directed toward the occult truths of the visible and invisible
worlds. Whether the physical man be under the rule of an empire
or a republic, concerns only the man of matter. His body may be
enslaved; as to his Soul, he has the right to give to his rulers the
proud answer of Socrates to his Judges. They have no sway over
the <i>inner</i> man." There speaks the true Mystic whose "Kingdom
is not of this world." Three years later H. P. B. and Colonel Olcott
published a further disclaimer, in which they said&mdash;"Before we came
to India, the word Politics had never been pronounced in connection
with our names; for the idea was too absurd to be even entertained,
much less expressed...."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The original documents appear in the <i>O. E. Critic</i> for June
21st, 1922, and include a confession signed by a priest of the L. C. C.
who states that he was "led astray by those whom I considered to
be my superiors both morally and spiritually" adding "Wedgwood
absolutely declines to give up the mal-practice." Wedgwood fled to
Algeria at the end of March. A cable from Sydney dated May 30th
states that "Mrs. Besant refused to answer any enquiry in reference
to Wedgwood. Police now holding an enquiry into the charges against
Leadbeater." Dr. Stokes concludes his comments on the documents
as follows:&mdash;"And Annie Besant, having repeatedly been informed
of the facts, not only refused to look into them, but launched her
anathemas against those who criticised, even threatening them with
expulsion from the E. S., and even very recently cabling to Wedgwood
that he made a mistake in resigning!&mdash;It is on Annie Besant, more
than on any other one person, that the responsibility for the present
scandalous condition in the T. S. rests. The best of societies may
have its black sheep and it is not to be blamed if it does its best to
purge itself. But it is Annie Besant, with her tools and sycophants,
who has ever concealed and denied the palpable facts, or, where they
could not be denied, has palliated, excused and even defended them,
throwing over them a veil of esoteric glamour, supporting such
scoundrels as Leadbeater and Wedgwood, apparently in order the
better to serve her ambitions. A vote of confidence in Annie Besant
to-day either betrays total ignorance of the facts, or associates those
who give it with the grossest forms of moral rottenness." <a href="#Piddington">See
Addendum</a> for Mr. Piddington, K. C's opinion on Mrs Besant's
conduct in Australia last May; also Mr. Hugh Gillespie's evidence
of her use of the Esoteric School as a "<i>political machine</i>" to secure
her "ascendancy in the various bodies to which E. S. members have
gained access."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> As to the methods employed to suppress criticism, Dr.
Hiestand-Moore says in the same issue:&mdash;"Slander, falsehood, deceit,
treachery, all have been summoned to the support of Mr. Leadbeater's
cause. Anonymous communications have been written to confound
the prosecution, letters have been stolen and threats made. The
Editor of <i>The Voice</i> has been compelled to call upon the Secret Service
to protect her mails." [An entire issue in proof with copy and unset
matter disappeared, and had to be rewritten!] Again, the Editor
of the <i>O. E. Critic</i> writes:&mdash;"It is understood, and I have the direct
testimony of the publisher to the fact, that the entire edition of the
Brooks' books [<i>Esoteric Bogeydom</i> and <i>Neo-Theosophy Exposed</i>] was
corralled by Mrs. Besant in order to suppress their circulation. They
tell too much about her."<br /><br /></p></div>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Tampering" id="Tampering"></a>Tampering with H. P. Blavatsky's writings.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE result of Mrs. Besant's first failure, through
harbouring doubts of her Teacher's <i>bona fides</i> and
esoteric knowledge, was soon manifested when she
began to publish new editions of H. P. B.'s works. The
first noteworthy example was her excision from <i>The Voice
of the Silence</i> of passages and notes, presumably out of
deference to Brahmin sentiment, which then governed
her actions. One of the last verses in "The Two Paths"
(the second of the "Three Fragments" forming the
little book) in the original edition (1889) begins thus:&mdash;
"He who becomes Pratyeka Buddha, makes his obeisance
but to his Self." In a footnote H. P. B. explains that
"Pratyeka Buddhas are those Bodhisattvas who strive
after and often reach the Dharmakaya robe after a
series of lives. Caring nothing for the woes of mankind
or to help it, but only for their own <i>bliss</i>, they enter
Nirvana and&mdash;disappear from the sight and the hearts
of men. In Northern Buddhism a 'Pratyeka Buddha'
is a synonym of spiritual Selfishness."</p>

<p>In Mrs. Besant's edition both the passage and the
footnote I have quoted are omitted. Her reason for this
unscrupulous proceeding is given in a footnote on p. 416
of the so-called "third volume" of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i>.
In this note Mrs. Besant, from the heights of her then
newly-acquired Brahmanical wisdom, adopts the following
dictatorial and censorious tone towards her late
Teacher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The Pratyeka Buddha stands on the level of the Buddha [!],
but His work for the world has nothing to do with its teaching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and His office has always been surrounded with
mystery. The preposterous [<i>sic</i>] view that He, at such
superhuman height of power, wisdom and love could be
selfish, is found in the exoteric books, though it is hard to
see how it can have arisen. H. P. B. <i>charged me to correct
the mistake, as she had, in a careless moment, copied such a
statement elsewhere</i>.&mdash;A. B.</p></blockquote>

<p>Observe the assumption of superior knowledge to
H. P. B.'s, and the use of the words "preposterous"
and "careless." To any real Oriental <i>chela</i> such an
attitude towards his <i>Guru</i> would be simply unthinkable;
but we have seen how very quickly Mrs. Besant believed
herself to have soared far above the "chela on probation"
state of her H. P. B. days into that of an "Initiate"
and future "Supreme Ruler of the World of Gods and
men." To such vanity and self-delusion everything is
possible. How different was the attitude of the <i>real</i>
Occultist who was spoken of by the Masters as "Our
Brother H. P. B.," yet called herself "a Chela of one
of Them"!</p>

<p>The passage I have italicised in the above footnote
by Mrs. Besant is untrue on the face of it to anyone
who knew, as I did, the loving care with which H. P.
B. prepared this unique little book of "Golden Precepts."
Moreover, she states in her Preface that the verses given
are selected from a much larger number which she
"learnt by heart." Further, H. P. B. <i>not only repeated
but greatly amplified</i> this statement about the Pratyeka
Buddha in her <i>Theosophical Glossary</i>, a fact which Mrs.
Besant had evidently forgotten when she concocted the
footnote quoted above.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Pratyeka Buddha is
doubtless much that Mrs. Besant claims for him, but
she does not seem to know, or has probably forgotten,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
that there are <i>two</i> classes of Masters, <i>two</i> "Paths"
(as this very section of <i>The Voice of the Silence</i> shows);
that the "Pairs of Opposites" obtain on all planes of
Manifestation and Being, right up to the threshold of
the <i>Un</i>manifested&mdash;the ONE; that, while there are
<i>Masters of</i> <span class="smcap">Compassion</span>, there must of necessity exist
also the opposite pole&mdash;the wearers of the "Dharmak&acirc;ya
robe," with all the power and knowledge which that
state implies, but without that <i>Compassion</i> which alone
makes a Master of the "Right Hand Path."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It was a great and valuable feature of H. P. B.'s,
method that she taught us to reason on these lines,
checking everything by the Law of Correspondences.
But Mrs. Besant has evidently long since abandoned
this, and prefers the sacerdotal plan of accepting everything
on "authority," which in her present phase means
Leadbeater or her own psychic delusions. The "World
Teacher" dogma is a case in point. She asserts it as
a fact to be accepted because she says it; whereas, as
I have shown, it is untenable in the light of <i>The Secret
Doctrine</i> (<a href="#Page_2">see <i>ante</i> p. 2</a>), which endorses Oriental tradition
and cyclic law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Besant's partiality for the Pratyeka Buddha,
however, may possibly be explained by some words
that H. P. B. once wrote of her to Mr. Judge:&mdash;"She
is not psychic or spiritual in the least&mdash;all intellect."
For H. P. B. opens her paragraph in the <i>Theosophical
Glossary</i> on the Pratyeka Buddha with these words:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&mdash;
"The Pratyeka Buddha is a degree which belongs
exclusively to the Yog㤨㳹a school ... one of <i>high
intellectual development with no true spirituality</i>". (Italics
mine.) Moreover, we have the authority of the Maha
Chohan Himself (the Head of the Trans-Him&acirc;layan
Brotherhood) for the statement that even Nirv㯡 is,
"after all, but an exalted and glorious selfishness."</p>

<p>In the <i>Theosophist</i> for March, 1922, Mrs. Besant
says, in her "Watch-Tower" notes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A wild theory has just been started in the U. S. A. that
<i>The Secret Doctrine</i>, brought out by the London T. P. H.
after H. P. B.'s death, was not as H. P. B. wanted it. The
<i>insinuation</i> is made that <i>H. P. B.</i> was "edited" by those
in charge of <i>the second edition</i>. The <i>trustees</i> to whom she
left <i>the safeguarding of her printed books and unpublished
manuscripts</i> were all her own pupils who had <i>lived with her
for years</i>, and they made only <i>such changes as she had herself
directed</i>, which consist mainly in the correction of verbal and
grammatical errors, and the <i>arrangement of the material of
Vol.</i> III.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have italicised the statements requiring explanation
or correction. The "second edition," as Mrs. Besant
must be well aware, was merely a re-print to meet an
unexpected demand, and bears the same date as the
original edition, <i>viz.</i>, 1888. But as Mrs. Besant only
joined the T. S. early in 1889, and was led to seek an
interview with H. P. Blavatsky <i>after</i> reviewing <i>The
Secret Doctrine</i> for the late Mr. W. T. Stead, then Editor
of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, clearly she can know absolutely
nothing of the preparation of its first <i>or</i> of its "second
edition"! As to the alleged "trustees," I can only say
that I never heard of their existence. <i>Mrs. Besant</i> only
"lived with" H. P. B. for rather more than eighteen
months. H. P. B. left 17, Lansdowne Road, London, W., in
the summer of 1889, the Headquarters being moved to Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Besant's house in Avenue Road, N.W., where she died
in May 1891, <i>while Mrs. Besant was on her way back
from a lecture tour in America</i>.</p>

<p>Take next the alleged "safeguarding" of H. P.
B.'s "unpublished manuscripts." Those who were
responsible for the so-called Volume III, had a strange
and unusual conception of the meaning of the word
"safeguarding." It so happens that while it was being
set up I was able actually to peruse one or two of the
familiar long foolscap sheets which H. P. B. always
covered with her small fine handwriting. They were
mutilated almost beyond recognition, few of her sentences
remaining intact; and there were "corrections" not
only in the handwritings of the editors, Mrs. Besant
and Mr. Mead, but also in that of others which I was
able to identify. More than this I cannot say without
abusing confidence; but the wrong done to my Teacher
compels me to say this much.</p>

<p>Those who were H. P. B.'s untiring and unfailing
helpers in the preparation of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> for
the press in 1887-88, Dr. Archibald and Mr. Bertram
Keightley, have, fortunately for posterity, put on record
their experiences of those days. They have made statements
of the utmost value in connection with the facts
I am here dealing with, which they wrote specially for
Countess Wachtmeister's <i>Reminiscences of H. P. Blavatsky
and "The Secret Doctrine,"</i> published in 1893. Moreover,
Dr. Keightley wrote an account of H. P. B.'s manifold
literary activities at this time, which appeared in the
<i>Theosophist</i> for July 1889, in which he states that "<i>the
Third Volume of The Secret Doctrine is in MS. ready to
be given to the printers</i>. [Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.] It
will consist mainly of a series of sketches of the great
Occultists of all ages, and is a most wonderful and
fascinating work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
In the face of this clear and definite statement,
made by one whose word I know to be unimpeachable,
and who lived and worked with H. P. B. at that time,
what becomes of H. P. B.'s alleged "directions" for
the "arrangement of the material of Vol. III" which Mrs.
Besant speaks of above, and the statement in the Preface
to <i>her</i> version of Vol. III:&mdash;"The task of preparing
this volume for the press has been a difficult and anxious
one.... The papers given to me by H. P. B. were
quite unarranged, and had no obvious order...."? This
volume, given by Mrs. Besant to the world in 1897, is
most certainly <i>not</i> the one Dr. Keightley speaks of as
"ready" for "the printers" in 1889, as I will prove.
<span class="smcap">What then became of that volume?</span></p>

<p>But first I will quote Dr. Stokes, Editor of the
<i>O. E. Critic</i>, whose most specific charges and plain
statements of fact hardly come under the purposely
misleading term "insinuations," used by Mrs. Besant!
Dr. Stokes "<i>insinuates</i>" nothing; he heads his most
damaging accusation as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><a name="Secret" id="Secret"></a>"<span class="smcap">Annie Besant's Corruption of the Secret
Doctrine.</span>"</p>

<blockquote><p>In all probability Annie Besant's "revision" of H. P.
Blavatsky's original edition of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> constitutes
the most colossal case of corruption of an original text
to be found in history. A group of students is comparing the
original edition with the "third and revised edition," edited
by Annie Besant and G. R. S. Mead, after the author's
death.... I am informed by those making the comparison
[that] ... the actual changes will be far more than twenty
thousand. Many of these changes are trivial and one wonders
at the impertinence or conceit which inspired them. Some
of the changes&mdash;those which might have put students on
their guard against the so-called Third Volume&mdash;can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
construed as deliberate and intentional suppressions and
corruptions of the original text. And this in a work of which
the Master K. H. wrote: "Every mistake or erroneous notion
corrected and explained by her from the works of other Theosophists
was corrected by me or under my instruction." The true
title of the "third and revised edition" should be "<i>The
Secret Doctrine</i>, written by H. P. Blavatsky, corrected and
approved by the Master K. H., and corrupted by Annie
Besant." It is almost impossible to comprehend the colossal
conceit, the limitless contempt for common literary decency
which could have inspired such an act of vandalism, to say
nothing of such disrespect for the Master whom she professes
to venerate. And all of this is put forth as the work of
H. P. Blavatsky herself, with the mere apology in the
preface that "Had H. P. Blavatsky lived to issue the new
edition, she would doubtless have corrected and enlarged it
to a very considerable extent." What a specious excuse?
[Repeated in the preface to the alleged Vol. III.&mdash;A. L. C.]
Had H. P. B. "corrected and enlarged it" it would without
doubt have been done under the same guidance and authority
which directed and corrected the first edition. It is enough
to cast suspicion on each and every quotation of original
sources made by Mrs. Besant, and her emendation of the
Theosophy of H. P. B. as well. (October 12th, 1921.)</p>

<p>As for the third volume, edited and published after the
death of H. P. B. from manuscripts left by her, nobody
knows, in the absence of a previous edition issued by her,
how much of it is H. P. B.'s and how much is not, but there
is good evidence that much of it is not, which is the more
likely in view of the vandalisms the same editors perpetrated
in the first two volumes. In no sense can the "third and
revised edition" be said to be a re-print of the original <i>Secret
Doctrine</i> of H. P. Blavatsky. (December 21st, 1921.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I most fully endorse all that Dr. Stokes so ably
demonstrates, and I can quite believe that, in regard
to Vol. III, some of the contents are not by H. P. B.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>&mdash;
the style in places is not hers at all. But I can enlighten
him as to those portions of the contents of which I have
actual knowledge. I may here add that, when my own
group of students were checking the "third and revised
edition" of the first and second volumes of <i>The Secret
Doctrine</i> by the original edition of 1888, they came
across no less than four specific references by H. P. B.
to Vols. III and IV as being practically completed, <i>viz.</i>,
Vol. I, Preface, and p. 11; Vol. II, pp. 437, 798, 1st
Ed., 1888. Mrs. Besant coolly deleted all these without
a word of explanation!</p>

<p>How unnecessary nearly all of this so-called
"revision" was, can be realised in the Keightleys'
accounts (see Countess Wachtmeister's book) of the care
taken over the proofs of the first edition. Mr. Bertram
Keightley says they first "read the whole mass of MSS.&mdash;a
pile over three feet high&mdash;most carefully through,
correcting the English and punctuation where absolutely
indispensable." (Contrast this modesty and respect for
the author with the spirit that perpetrated the thirty
thousand corrections in the "third edition"!) It was
then arranged under H. P. B.'s supervision in Sections,
etc., and professionally typewritten. This first copy was
again revised and any obscurities explained. It should
be noted here that Mr. Keightley says they laid before
H. P. B. "a plan, suggested by the character of the
matter itself, <i>viz.</i>, to make the work consist of four
volumes ... to follow the natural order of exposition
and begin with the Evolution of Cosmos, to pass from
that to the Evolution of Man, then to deal with the
historical part in a third volume treating of the lives
of some great Occultists, and of 'Practical Occultism'
in a fourth." This proves that at least the whole of
the material for Vol. III was actually there (Dr. Keightley
elsewhere states that it was <i>ready for the printer</i>.) Finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the Keightleys themselves set to work to type out a
fair copy of Vols. I and II for the printer. "H. P. B.
read and corrected two sets of galley proofs, then a
page proof, and finally a revise in sheet, correcting,
adding, and altering up to the very last moment."</p>

<p>Dr. A. Keightley says:&mdash;" ... no work and no
trouble, no suffering or pain could daunt her from her
task. Crippled with rheumatism, suffering from a
disease which had several times nearly proved fatal,
she still worked on unflaggingly, writing at her desk
the moment her eyes and fingers could guide the pen....
We had to carry on the general scheme ... to
act as watch-dogs and help her to make the meaning
as clear as possible. But all the work was hers ...
it went through three or four other hands besides H.
P. B.'s in galley proof, as well as in revise. She was
her own most severe corrector...."</p>

<p>Another able helper was Mr. E. Douglas Fawcett,
the well-known author of <i>The Riddle of the Universe</i>,
of whom both the Keightleys speak in terms of high
praise. His profound knowledge of science, philosophy,
and metaphysics was invaluable. "He supplied many
of the quotations from scientific works, as well as many
confirmations of the occult doctrines derived from
similar sources."</p>

<p>And this monumental work, produced with such
meticulous care and precautions against errors, is
subjected to some thirty thousand corrections by its
subsequent "editors"! In all my study of the original
edition I have never found more than a few errors that
matter in the least, and these are mostly typographical
and quite obvious to any person of average intelligence.
The marvel is that there are so few in a work of such
magnitude and scope. Those of my students who
possess only the "third and revised edition" (the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and second now being scarce), have re-corrected it to
agree with the first; and to look at the pages covered
with these re-corrections brings home to one, as nothing
else can, the force and justice of Dr. Stokes's indictment.
Let us hope that when H. P. B.'s great work is understood
and accepted seriously at its true worth, an indignant
posterity will pass judgment on one of the worst
examples of literary vandalism in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In her Preface to Vol. III, Mrs. Besant boldly states
that, in regard to the Sections entitled "The Mystery
of Buddha," there are "very numerous errors of fact,
and many statements based on exoteric writings, not
on esoteric knowledge"! If her own statement with
which I have dealt, regarding the Pratyeka Buddha is
to be taken as the measure of her capacity to judge of
the merit or demerit of H. P. B.'s work, all that Mrs.
Besant says, or skilfully suggests, in this Preface can be
dismissed as absolutely worthless. But in view of the
fact that she then believed herself to be acting under
the direction of "a Master in the flesh" (<a href="#Page_18">see Mr. Martyn's
letter, <i>ante</i> pp. 18-19</a> and <a href="#Footnote_11_11">footnote p. 56</a>), who happened
to be <i>an orthodox Brahmin</i>, these unfounded pronouncements
which I quote with regard to the Sections on the
Lord Buddha are perhaps not so surprising. I use the
word "unfounded" advisedly, for she makes two
separate statements as to the way in which she obtained
the material for this so-called Vol. III. She opens the
Preface with the first one:&mdash;"The task of preparing
this volume for the press has been a difficult and anxious
one, and it is necessary to state clearly what has been
done." This is one of her usual formulas, after which
she proceeds to do the exact opposite. She thus
continues, in fact:&mdash;"The papers given to me by
H. P. B...." But Mrs. Besant was not in England
when H. P. B. died, <i>quite unexpectedly</i>, and with only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
three of her pupils present, namely, Mr. Claude Wright,
Mr. Walter Old and Miss Laura Cooper (now Mrs. G. R.
S. Mead.) We were all summoned by telegram, and I
was at Avenue Road within a few hours. I never heard
of any evidence that she gave Mrs. Besant papers, or
directions about papers, before the latter left for America
on a lecture tour; and most certainly H. P. B. never
formally "appointed" her, or anyone else, as her
"successor," for the very good reason that I have
given elsewhere&mdash;that the movement had definitely
failed, and she was "recalled." (<a href="#Page_2">see <i>ante</i> p. 2</a>.)</p>

<p>To return to Mrs. Besant's Preface. Her second
statement is that the papers for the Sections on "The
Mystery of the Buddha" were "given into my hands
to publish, as part of the Third Volume of <i>The Secret
Doctrine</i>...." <i>By whom</i> were they "given"? Certainly
not by H. P. B.; and why does Mrs. Besant speak of
these Sections on the Buddha as if they were something
apart from the "papers" she alleges she received <i>from
H. P. B.</i>? Clearly any further analysis is useless, for
in all probability the truth about what really happened
to all H. P. B.'s MSS. after her death <i>will never be known</i>,
since the few who do know will, naturally, never speak.</p>

<p>Brushing aside, therefore, Mrs. Besant's "explanatory"
Preface, Volume III, as given to the public in
1897, appears to be simply a collection of fugitive articles
which, as I have shown, were obviously freely edited.
To pad out the volume (the MSS. spoken of by H. P. B.
in Vols. I and II, as already existing, having mysteriously
vanished) Mrs. Besant prints both the <i>E. S. T.</i> and the
<i>Inner Group Instructions</i>, despite the pledge of secrecy
taken by her and all other recipients of these teachings.
In justification of this she states&mdash;<i>six years after H. P.
B.'s death</i>&mdash;that H. P. B. instructed her to do so! The
worthlessness of such "instructions" is palpable in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
light of her na&iuml;ve belief in the alleged reincarnation of her
Teacher in Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s little daughter. (Needless to add that,
under Leadbeater, she has another version of this idea!)
We have the usual misleading and disingenuous statement
in a "Note" which is prefixed to these Instructions. Mrs.
Besant says:&mdash;"Papers I, II and III ... were written by
H. P. B. and were circulated privately during her lifetime"</p>

<p><i>These</i> "<i>Papers</i>" <i>are the E. S. Instructions.</i> She
calls those given to the Inner Group "Notes of some
Oral Teaching." But, with two exceptions, almost <i>every
word of both E. S. and I. G. Instructions are given intact</i>,
just as we received them; I possess them all. The
two exceptions are, first, the practical teachings, given
at the first meeting of the <i>I. G.</i>, for Yoga development,
which even Mrs. Besant had not the hardihood to
publish; and, second, a very long "Preliminary Memorandum"
to Instructions III.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Truth" id="Truth"></a>The Truth about the E. S. Council, and the Inner Group.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE E. S. Instructions were written by H. P. B.
during the winter of 1888-89. The I. G. Teachings
were given orally by H. P. B. at its meetings in
1890-91. It was the duty of the two secretaries,
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Mead, to write these Teachings up,
from notes sent in by <i>all of us</i>, after each meeting, and
record them in a book. This record was dealt with at
each succeeding meeting, corrected and often amplified by
H. P. B. All these <i>might</i>, therefore, have been included
in Vol. IV of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i>, according to the
general plan of the work adopted by H. P. B., if she
had lived and had permitted it. Mrs. Besant's statement
that they were written with that in view is incorrect,
and was obviously made to justify her action in using
them for her version of Vol. III.</p>

<p>In the <i>Theosophist</i> for March, 1922, Mrs. Besant
published an article in which several false statements
are made concerning the history of the E. S. The
writer, a Mr. Fritz Kunz, quotes Colonel Olcott's <i>Old
Diary Leaves</i> as authority for saying that "the first
move towards founding the E. S. was made in 1881,"
that it was "organised steadily through the trials of
1884-85," and merely "announced" in 1888. The
actual facts (see <i>Theosophist</i>, April, 1880) are, that when
H. P. B. established the real <span class="smcap">Theosophical Society or
Universal Brotherhood</span> at Benares in 1879 (the T. S.
founded at New York in 1875 was only a "Miracle
Club," as Colonel Olcott says, with no "brotherhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
plank"), it was on a purely esoteric basis. It was under
the direct guidance of the Trans-Him㭡yan Brotherhood,
Who formed the First Section; the second and third
being for "accepted" and "probationary" <i>chelas</i>
respectively. When I joined the T. S. in 1885, these
rules were still in force in the London Lodge. But
Colonel Olcott insisted on an exoteric organisation with
"the occultism more in the background"; and the
crisis of 1884-85, which drove H. P. B. from India (<a href="#Page_2">see
her letter of 1890, <i>ante</i> p. 2</a>), was the natural result
of this policy. Far from the E. S. being "organised
steadily" at that time, as Mr. Kunz asserts, H. P. B.
makes it clear in her letter that the Master's influence
was "virtually banished" from Adyar through lack of
faith in Them, and failure to support her, and that she
had been ordered to "establish the Esoteric Section,"
at London, which she did in 1888, because the necessary
faith in the Masters still existed there and in America.</p>

<p>Mr. Kunz then makes the astonishing assertion that the
E. S. was "transferred to Mrs. Annie Besant in due course
by H. P. B. in 1891." As I was a member of H. P. B.'s
Inner Council which was responsible for what was done
after her death, I am in a position to state the true
facts as known to me, and as they appear in the E. S.
documents in my possession. These <i>facts</i> are:&mdash;When
H. P. B. died&mdash;suddenly and unexpectedly, on May 8th,
1891<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>., Mr. Judge at once came over from New York,
and after much consultation and informal meetings of the
E. S. Council (composed of the I. G. members) and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
others, Mr. Wm. Kingsland and Dr. W. Wynn Westcott), a
formal and "full meeting of the Council" was held at
Headquarters on May 27th, 1891, when "Bro. Wm. Q.
Judge attended <i>as the representative of H. P. B.</i> under a
general power given as below." (Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.)</p>

<p>"As Head of the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical
Society, I hereby declare that William Q. Judge, of
New York, U.S., in virtue of his character as a <i>chela</i>
of thirteen years' standing, and of the trust and confidence
reposed in him, is my only representative for said
Section in America, and he is the sole channel through
whom will be sent and received all communications
between the members of said Section and myself, and
to him full faith, confidence and credit in that regard
are to be given, &#8258; Done at London this fourteenth
day of December, 1888, and in the fourteenth
year of the Theosophical Society.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[Seal]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  H. P. Blavatsky, &there4;</span><br />
</p>

<p>" ... The Council passed the following minute....</p>

<p>That it was resolved and recorded that the highest
officials in the School for the present are Annie Besant
and William Q. Judge, in accordance with the above-quoted
order to William Q. Judge of December, 1888,
and with the order of April 1st, 1891, to Annie Besant,
as well as with the written declaration of H. P. B. in
a letter to William Q. Judge dated March 27th, 1891,
which we now here have read, in which she wrote that
Annie Besant should be so considered. The order of
April 1st, 1891, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I hereby appoint, in the name of the Master, Annie Besant
Chief Secretary of the Inner Group of the Esoteric Section and
Recorder of the Teachings.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, we&mdash;the Council&mdash;declared over our signatures
that "from henceforth with Annie Besant and
William Q. Judge rest the full charge and management
of the School."</p>

<p>Thus did <i>the Council</i> establish the "Dual Headship,"
and until her meeting with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, two years
later, and her subsequent visit to India, Mrs. Besant
continued to work harmoniously with Mr. Judge in the
management of the School.</p>

<p>A full report of this Council meeting was immediately
sent out to the whole E. S., bearing the date May 27th,
1891. Attached to it was an "Address" signed by
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Judge as joint "Outer Heads,"
declaring that these "changes in the Constitution of
the School" having been "made <i>by the joint Councils
of the</i> E. S. T." (Italics mine.&mdash;A. L. C.), they considered
it their "duty" to issue this address to each member.</p>

<p><i>The one error</i>, and the foundation of all subsequent
ones, as I subsequently realised, was that of speaking
of themselves as H. P. B.'s "agents and representatives
after her departure"; for there is nothing whatever in
the wording of the abovementioned official appointments
which even suggests such a contingency. <i>Both</i> obviously
could refer to the holders of them only <i>during</i> H. P. B.'s
<i>life-time</i>. Indeed, Mr. Judge's was made when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
School was founded, and had been operative ever since;
while Mrs. Besant's was merely an official confirmation
of a secretarial office she had filled since the formation
of the I. G. scarcely nine months previously (thus giving
her the precedence of Mr. Mead.) It will be seen, however,
that Mr. Judge's appointment was a far more
important one than Mrs. Besant's, and was conferred on
him "in virtue of his character as <i>a chela of thirteen
years' standing</i>"; whereas Mrs. Besant had been "on
probation" <i>only</i>, for barely a year. Moreover, when
Mr. Judge became the object of attacks in 1889, H. P.
B. issued the following very significant notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">London</span>,<br />
<i>October 23rd, 1889</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"The Esoteric Section and its life in the U. S. A.
depends upon W. Q. J. remaining its agent and what
he is now. The day W. Q. J. resigns H. P. B. will be
virtually dead for the Americans. W. Q. J. is the
Antaskarana between the two <i>Manas(es)</i>, the American
thought and the Indian&mdash;or rather the trans-Him&acirc;layan
esoteric knowledge. <i>Dixi.</i></p>

<p>
H. P. B. &there4;<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>P. S.</i>&mdash;W. Q. J. had better show and impress <i>this</i>
on the mind of <i>all those it may concern</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>This notice appeared in an E. S. paper issued by
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Judge, dated July 18th, 1894,
when Mrs. Besant was already implicated in the plot
against Mr. Judge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Besant's appointment, given above, was the
only official one she ever received from H. P. B. in
either the E. S. or T. S. Certainly I never heard of
anything else. The absolutely Jesuitical nature of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
methods is patent, in that she <i>completely ignores</i> the
documentary facts set forth above. To read the present
statements it might be imagined that Mr. Judge hardly
existed at that time, except as an obscure person who,
as Mr. Kunz tactfully (!) puts it, made an "unfortunate
blunder." As I have shown elsewhere (<a href="#Page_5">see <i>ante</i> pp 5</a>, <a href="#Page_70">70</a>);
it is the fact that "blunders"&mdash;and worse than blunders&mdash;were
made after H. P. B.'s death (<a href="#Page_86">see <i>ante</i> p. 86</a>);
but Mrs. Besant's "blunders" were far more serious
than Mr. Judge's; though both of them were, in the
first instance, misled by others, whose real aim was to
disrupt the Society and defeat H. P. B.'s work.</p>

<p>I possess a copy of the previously mentioned most
valuable "Preliminary Memorandum" to Instructions
III, as issued by H. P. B. to her students; and a prefatory
note states:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The following "Preliminary Memorandum" was written
by H. P. B. at the time of a grave crisis, or rather series
of crises, through which the T. S. passed in 1889-90.
Treachery within the E. S. itself, and persistent and relentless
attacks on the T. S. from without, especially in America
necessitated the striking of a fresh keynote and giving
directions for the closing up of the ranks of the E. S. At
the time of reprinting the Instructions in London in 1890-91,
certain portions of this "Preliminary Memorandum" dealing
with the details of the matter were purposely omitted by
those of H. P. B.'s pupils who were constituted the editors
[Mrs. Besant and Mr. Mead], these portions being deemed by
them of too personal a character to remain. This was done
when H. P. B. was too ill to supervise, without her sanction,
and, as she afterwards said, much against her wishes. [Some
of the details omitted related to attacks on Mr. Judge, and
the duty of defending him "when the time comes."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Mr. Mead omitted from his "third and
revised edition" of H. P. B.'s <i>Key to Theosophy</i>, published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in 1893, most of the part in which the author deals with
the Report of the Society for Psychical Research, classing
it with "passages of a controversial nature, which are
no longer of general interest." Yet the public at large
still accept this Report as a proof that H. P. B. was
a fraud, a charlatan, and a Russian spy!</p>

<p>Another feature of this edition, as of others of her
works produced after her death, is what he calls "a
systematic use of italics and capitals." This means that
he abandons H. P. B.'s extremely effective use of large
and small capitals and italics to emphasise the importance
of words like MYSTERIES, OCCULTISM, WISDOM-RELIGION,
etc., or SELF, <span class="smcap">Self</span>, and <i>Self</i> to indicate
the three different selves in man, and so robs her text
of much of its emphasis and meaning. One has to
compare her editions with these posthumos ounes to
realise the extent to which this has been done. It is
particularly noticeable in <i>The Voice of the Silence</i>, where
the exact meaning often depends on the distinctions
H. P. B. thus makes. (<a href="#Occultism">See her article on Occultism
quoted <i>ante</i> p. 31</a>).<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><a name="Conclusion" id="Conclusion"></a><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></p>

<p>If the "Back to Blavatsky" movement accomplishes
nothing else, let us hope it may succeed in getting rid
of all this vandalism and re-establishing H. P. B.'s works
on their original basis, that she may go down to posterity
on her own merits and not altered and distorted by the
brain-mind notions of her followers. Some of this work
is already being done by organisations or private enterprise,
but it needs to be systematised and co-ordinated.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Although the "door" had to be "shut" at the end
of 1899, H. P. B. in her last paragraph of the <i>Key to
Theosophy</i> expressed the hope that, "when the time
comes for the effort of the twentieth century [<i>i.e.</i>, in
1975], besides a large and accessible literature ready
to men's hands, the next impulse will find a numerous
and <i>united</i> body of people ready to welcome the new
Torch-bearer of Truth."</p>

<p>It has been my painful task to show how lamentably
we have failed to realise her hopes. The "<i>united</i> body"
she sacrificed so much to create and hold together, was
disrupted barely four years after her death; the main
body under the Besant-Leadbeater <i>r&eacute;gime</i> is following
strange gods; while the great literary legacy left by
H. P. B. has not only been seriously tampered with,
but even largely superseded and obscured by books
which will certainly not be of any assistance to the
next "Torch-Bearer."</p>

<p>Some years ago I founded an H. P. B. Lending
Library with my original editions of her works, and
others that are reliable and in line with her teaching.
It has already done much good, especially among those
who have been misled and kept in ignorance of them.
If others would do the same we can in time hope to
stem the tide of evil and error, and preserve H. P. B.'s
message untainted until 1975. It is now within the
life-span of our younger students, many of whom, as
the children of Theosophists, have been brought up on
the teachings and will bridge the gap for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
The bridging of this gap, however, has been rendered
more difficult than it should have been; first, by the
failure of the T. S. as <i>a living spiritual force in the world</i>;
and second, by the sinister activities of this "ill-omened
partnership" which almost immediately followed. The
whole tragic and dreadful history, fragments only of
which I have been able to give in this brief examination,
proves what incalculable harm "Leadbeaterism" is
working on the minds of the rising generation. Not only
is he the virtual director of Mrs. Besant's Society, but
he has completely infected <i>her</i> mind with his soul-destroying
teachings. Hers is the real responsibility,
therefore<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; and hers the <i>karma</i> of ruining H. P. B.'s
life-work, and carrying with her in her fall thousands
upon thousands of honest, but too credulous and easily
deceived souls along the broad and flowery road "leading
to destruction."</p>

<p>As H. P. B. says in concluding her "Occultism
<i>versus</i> the Occult Arts":&mdash;"If, while turning their
backs on the narrow gate, they are dragged by their
desire for the Occult one step in the direction of the
broad and more inviting Gates of that golden mystery
which glitters in the light of illusion, woe to them!
It can lead only to Dugpa-ship, and they will be sure
to find themselves very soon landed on that <i>Via Fatale</i> of
the <i>Inferno</i>, over whose portal Dante read the words:&mdash;</p>


<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">"<i>Per me si va nella cittᡤolente</i><br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><i>Per me si va nell'eterno dolore</i><br /></span>

development," under special conditions and "under observation."

there endorsed by an Initiate of a higher grade. It will also be
noticed that the dots forming the triangle after her signature differ
in size in the two orders. In a note in the <i>Voice of the Silence</i> to the
words "Thyself and mind, like twins upon a line, the star which
is thy goal burns overhead" H. P. B. says "Every stage of development
in <i>Raja-Yoga</i> is symbolised by a geometrical figure. This one
is the sacred <i>Triangle</i> [<i>i.e.</i>,&there4;] and precedes Dharana. The &Delta; is

Doctrine</i> is so scarce, students will be glad to know that an unaltered
reprint can now be had instead of the Besant corruption. The
reprint of <i>Isis Unveiled</i>, with the addition of an excellent Index, has
long been wanted; and the original paging has been preserved, so
that the Index also serves for the original edition. It is to be regretted
that these reprints are prefaced by an account of the Theosophical
Movement from Mrs. Tingley's point of view, which is inaccurate
and misleading. However, this is easily removed.</p></div>

<h2><br /><br /><a name="Australian" id="Australian"></a><i>ADDENDUM.</i></h2>

<p class="center"><b>The Australian Crisis.</b></p>


<p>The official account of the events in Australia last spring
reached me too late to include in its proper place (<a href="#Page_4"><i>ante</i>, p. 4</a>),
but its importance as the latest phase of the Leadbeater
scandal demands quotation of the principal details. Australia
has been the scene of Mr. Leadbeater's activities since the
Madras lawsuits (<a href="#Madras"><i>ante</i>, p. 39</a>) made India too hot for him
in 1913. Needless to say, the same scandals were repeated
there, and finally brought about a crisis at the T. S. Convention
last Easter in Sydney. Two of Mr. Leadbeater's Indian
"pupils," Krishnamurti (<a href="#Page_12">see <i>ante</i>, p. 12</a>) and Jinarajadasa,
secured a vote of confidence in Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater
which roused strong opposition. I quote from a long
circular letter issued to the members by one of the opposition,
Mr. J. M. Prentice, of Hobart, who is evidently a
leading officer. It is dated May 28, 1922.<br /><br /></p>


<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Besant Refuses an Enquiry.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Soon after Convention Mrs. Besant arrived in Sydney [from India]
a very worried and angry woman. At the Sydney Lodge she spoke on
the lines of "Judge not that ye be not judged," and made it thoroughly
apparent that she was not in favour of anything in the nature of an
Enquiry. During the Convention Leadbeater had issued a special
statement to the E. S. T. which led to its expulsion from the Sydney
Lodge building. It was this that had finally angered Mrs. Besant to
boiling point.... She expressed a wish to meet the Lodge Committee
and talk over the difficulties. There was a three-hour conference that
led nowhere. I am told that she was helpless to a point of pathos. She
denied everything as far as Leadbeater and Wedgwood [<a href="#Page_62">see <i>ante</i>, p. 62</a>]
were, concerned, and refused to consider anything in the nature of an
Enquiry. She read from old files of the <i>Theosophist</i> how Leadbeater
had been rehabilitated, but a member of the Executive challenged her
with more recent happenings, to which she could only reply that she
did "not believe them."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Terrific Press Criticism</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> came out with a tremendous
attack on the "Liberal Catholic Church." The result was terrific. At
the members' meeting that night feeling ran very high. The <i>Telegraph</i>
had a reporter present and came out with six or seven columns under
heavily leaded headlines. Moreover this information was disseminated
to all the papers the <i>Telegraph</i> is correspondent for. The result is that
irreparable damage has been done to Theosophy and the Society;
although the ablest papers are willing to admit that there is still a
minority genuinely fighting for sanity and cleanness in the T. S.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Government Enquiry Instituted</span>.</p>

<p>The Government has now instituted an Enquiry, but so far I do not
know the scope of its intention. I have been told by telegram that the
Leadbeater boys have been examined or interrogated.... One of the
latest developments was when Mr. A. B. Piddington, a leading barrister
and K. C. of Sydney, resigned from the Presidency of the Public
Questions Society of Sydney University rather than meet Mrs.
Besant at a public address which she proposed to give to the members.
He has addressed a scathing letter to the <i>Telegraph</i>, or rather released for
publication his letter of resignation, which is a remarkable summing-up
of the position.<br /><br /></p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><a name="Piddington" id="Piddington"></a><span class="smcap">Mr. Piddington, K. C.'s Opinion</span>.</p>

<p>The following are the chief points made by this gentleman,
who is not a member of the T. S., and therefore represents
an impartial legal and public view of the moral issue at
stake:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>My resignation is based on the ground that the Society ought to
withdraw its invitation to Mrs. Besant until the matters involved in her
defence of Mr. C. W. Leadbeater have been settled by a trustworthy
tribunal.</p>

<p>Grave allegations were recently made against Mr. Leadbeater by Mr.
Martyn [<a href="#Page_18">see <i>ante</i>, p. 18</a>,] for his letter to Mrs. Besant, and Mr. Leadbeater's
precept and practice in the training of boys have been quoted.
Mr. Martyn is supported by other reputable Australians.</p>

<p>Before landing here, and since, Mrs. Besant has refused any inquiry
into these matters, and taken up positions which, in a teacher of morals
disentitle her to be heard by an undergraduate society which exists for
the pursuit of truth. These positions are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That there is a class of beings so high in the religious order that to
accuse them is presumption on the part of the common people. Indeed
accusations are 'persecution,' which proves the sanctity of these higher
beings, and is (in Mrs. Besant's words) the "seal of their apostolate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>2. Mrs. Besant refers Mr. Leadbeater's challengers to the courts,
though to propagate in private the abominable tenet held by him does
not constitute an offence against any law, but only against common
decency as understood by ordinary men.</p>

<p>3. She writes that she does not believe, and will not discuss Mr.
Martyn's allegations, though she writes from India of what Mr.
Martyn says happened in his own home in Sydney.</p>

<p>If these are good reasons for refusing to hold an inquiry, then immorality
can be safely taught and practised in high places so long as the
teacher belongs to Mrs. Besant's way of thinking. From the public
point of view such a claim cuts the ground from all morals.</p>

<p>In her letter to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> [of Sydney] for May 18, Mrs.
Besant asks the public to believe that Mr. Leadbeater has to meet
charges relating to 1906 [<a href="#Page_27">see <i>ante</i>, p. 27</a>], and disposed of [?] by some
private investigation in 1908. The fact is ignored that Mr. Martyn's
accusations relate to conduct since 1914, Worse than this, the fact is
suppressed that Mrs. Besant in 1913 was herself ordered by the Madras
High Court to return to their father two boys whom she insisted in
placing in Mr. Leadbeater's care, in spite of the father's protest.
[<a href="#Page_40">See <i>ante</i>, p. 40</a>] ... Mr. Justice Bakewell said that, from
Leadbeater's evidence, he was "certainly an immoral person, and
highly unfit to be in charge of the boys." He also found that Mrs.
Besant had violated her stipulation made with the father before
parting with the boys, that they should have nothing to do with Mr.
Leadbeater. (London <i>Times</i>, March 8, 1913.)</p>

<p>In the following year Mr. Leadbeater came to Australia and now
"trains" Australian boys.</p>

<p>Mrs. Besant lent herself and her oratory to the acquittal, without
evidence, of Mr. Leadbeater at a public meeting ... In my view it is
as bad to rescue a man from public justice (which is a wider term than
criminal law) by the exercise of a dominating personal veto, as it is to do
it by money or social or any other 'influence'&mdash;'influence' which is the
bane of any system of justice.... She may effect a master-stroke of
salvage, but she offends every canon of fairplay, let alone of that ordinary
morality by which all men, high or humble, must be content to be
judged. These sombre facts stand out:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Mrs. Besant's chief colleague has stated as late as 1913 in open
court that he still believed in teaching a detestable vice to boys, which
he had previously taught them.</p>

<p>2. An English Judge for this reason declared him to be an immoral
person.</p>

<p>3. Mr. Martyn accused Mr. Leadbeater of being still what the
English judge said of him, and alleged fact upon fact in support of this.</p>

<p>4. Mrs. Besant has shielded Mr. Leadbeater from inquiry.</p>

<p>5. Mr. Leadbeater says nothing.<br /><br /></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><a name="Indictment" id="Indictment"></a><span class="smcap">An Indictment of Mrs. Besant by a Resigning Member
Of Her E. S.</span></p>

<p>Further very recent testimony and criticism is furnished
by a letter of resignation from Mrs. Besant's Esoteric School
by Mr. Hugh R. Gillespie, of Krotona, California, one of the
strongholds of the "Liberal Catholic Church." The letter,
dated May 29, is printed in the <i>O. E. Critic</i> of August 16,
and the Editor in a prefatory note says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The writer ... is well-known to Theosophists of three continents
as a lecturer and as a fearless, persistent and uncompromising fighter for
honesty and cleanness in the T. S. For almost three years he was
attached to Adyar as architect and sanitary engineer.... He was at
Adyar during the trial of the "Cases" in the Madras courts and saw
the whole sordid drama in action. During this period he had abundant
opportunity for getting light, as well as sidelights, on the working of the
Adyar machine and on the personal peculiarities of the gods and
demigods of the Theosophical Olympus. Later he was resident three
years at Krotona, where similar opportunities were not lacking.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gillespie writes that he resigns as a protest against
the actions and utterances of Mrs. Besant as "Outer Head"
of the E. S. and President of the T. S., and continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>These actions and utterances have, since her assumption of the
above mentioned positions, been of such a character that, to use the
words of H. P. B., the Theosophical Society is</p>

<p>" ... being made a spectacle to the world through the exaggerations
of some fanatics, and the attempt of various charlatans to profit
by a ready-made programme. These, by disfiguring and adapting
Occultism to their own filthy and immoral ends bring disgrace on the
whole movement."</p>

<p>As a result of Mrs. Besant's methods we learn that the T. S. and
E. S. in almost every section is seething with dissension. England,
Australia and America are racked and torn; Germany is split; Finland
is shattered, and the closing of the E. S. for some four years in
Switzerland indicates the conditions there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Besant's arrogance and vanity in office and her lack of dignity,
as exemplified in her ridiculous "Whom will ye serve?" tirade, and her
letter of March, 1922, have drawn the attention of the great London
weekly <i>Truth</i>, and in its pages the T. S. is held up to the scorn and
ridicule of the world. [I have dealt with these under the heading of
"Mrs Besant's Latest Assertions and Claims Examined."&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>So far as the E. S. is concerned, my experience of its working under
Mrs. Besant in Australia, Adyar, England, and America enable me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
assert that it is nothing but a political machine used for the purpose of
securing the ascendancy of Mrs. Besant in the various bodies to which
E. S. members have gained access. [I would draw particular attention
to this important statement. It is especially true of India, which is
the principal scene of her political activities.&mdash;A. L. C.]</p>

<p>... Mrs. Besant's parade of thrusting the L. C. C. out of the
T. S. door while bringing it in by the E. S. window, added to her condonement
of the vile practices of the L. C. C. bishops and priests, fall
little short of a betrayal of the T S. and could only be adequately met
by her resignation from all office....<br /><br /></p></blockquote>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
